# PREFACE

The Indian Institute of Technology at Kharagpur is the first of the sixteen Institutes established in the IIT system. Established in 1951, IIT Kharagpur stands tall for its excellence in Academics and Research with top class faculty. With 19 Academic Departments, 7 Centers & 8 Schools of Excellence, the Institute offers 15 B.Tech.(Hons.) Programs, 38 Dual Degree Programs, 2 Interdisciplinary Dual Degree Programs, 6 Integrated M.Sc. Programs and 5 Two Year M.Sc. degree programs of Joint M.Sc.-Ph.D.

The Undergraduate courses at IIT Kharagpur are known for their academic depth and professional learning flexibility, imbibed with options to earn minor or extra credits. Having an apt mix of basic sciences, engineering sciences, professional core of the major discipline, humanities courses, management subjects, project work, open electives and industrial training, the courses give a professional edge to the students. The system stimulates broad spectrum learning. Extra Academic activity is a non credit component of the curriculum that not only helps the students in character and personality building but also in understanding the needs of the society and contributing in an effective way to meet these social challenges.

IIT Kharagpur follows a credit based semester system. There are two Semesters in an academic year (Autumn: July - November; and Spring: January - April) during which all courses specified for various degree programs are offered. There is one additional term of seven week duration during summer, for the theory subjects of the first year to offer additional training to students who do not clear these subjects. The Institute has recently launched an International Summer /Winter Term Program which is open to all students. The students get an opportunity to seek knowledge and experience from International faculty in various multidisciplinary subjects.

IIT Kharagpur is a very student friendly place and all efforts are made to ensure that the students are provided the best opportunities that are needed to create outstanding pool of human resources to meet the global challenges in all spheres.

The students are required to follow certain procedures and meet specified academic requirements each semester. This booklet gives comprehensive information on the existing Rules and Regulations for B.Tech.(Hons.), Dual Degree and M.Sc. Programs.

We urge the students to make best use of the world class infrastructure and facilities available at IIT Kharagpur and wish all of them all the very best for a successful career.

Dean (UGS)

### 1. Academic Administration

 The Senate is a statutory and supreme body that governs all academic matters of the Institute, and the rulings of Senate Chairman (Director of The Institute) are final in regard to all academic issues. A definite time schedule is set by the Senate for various academic activities, through an Academic Calendar issued in the beginning of each academic year. The Senate continuously assesses the Academic Programs and makes appropriate revisions/ modifications/improvements as and when required through three Institute level Senate subcommittees: The Under-Graduate Program Evaluation Committee (UGPEC) for undergraduate programs, the Post-Graduate Program Evaluation Committee (PGPEC) for post-graduate programs, and the Research Program Evaluation Committee (RPEC) for research programs. Administrative back-up and support for all academic activities is provided by the Academic Section and the ERP system of the Institute. On joining the Institute, students of each discipline are assigned to a Faculty Advisor from their Department. Faculty Advisors assist the students on matters relating to their academic performance and the courses they may take in various semesters.

Dean (Undergraduate Studies) and Dean (Students' Affairs) are the two Chief Academic Authorities for the Undergraduate (UG) Programs. All the UG Academic matters come under the purview of Dean (Undergraduate Studies). Matters pertaining to conduct, discipline and welfare of the students are overseen by the Dean (Students' Affairs).

- 17.8 The subject and grade will be mentioned in transcript / grade card and will be used to compute CGPA for additional subjects and will be shown as ACGPA. Failures will be marked by F grade. There will be no supplementary examination for such subjects. In the case of failure in the micro-credit subject, the student should repeat the micro-credit subject if offered in the next offered semester. The student is permitted to take alternate micro-credit subject if the subject is not offered in the next semester. (Senate Item 321.A.I.C.1).
- 18.3 However, in case the micro-credit is accepted as a subject contributing to the curricular requirement, it will be accounted for in the CGPA calculations.
- 18.4 A student is normally not expected to take more than 2 such courses in a semester. The subject may also be a part of minor and micro‐specialization.
- 18.5 The students can register for Micro-credit subjects with EAA as backlog (Senate Item 322.H.I.C.6). .

# 19. Minor in a Discipline

- 19.1 A department would offer a MINOR in a discipline in which it offers a major.
- 19.2 The department would enlist a set of subjects from its curriculum and prescribe a requirement for minor taking six subjects or more (18-24 contact-hours plus 3-9 hours of laboratory) from this set. The subjects would be a combination of mostly core and some electives.
- 19.3 Students aspiring for a Minor in a discipline must register for the same in the beginning of the 5th semester. Only those students, who have a CGPA of 7.5 or above, without any Backlog, will be permitted to register for a Minor. An SGPA or CGPA in excess of 8.0 has to be maintained in the subsequent semesters without any Backlog in order to keep the Minor registration active. Should both the SGPA and CGPA fall below 8.0 at any point after registering for the minor; the Minor registration will cease to be active.
- 19.4 A student registered for Minor in a discipline must register and pass in all subjects that constitute the requirement for a minor and score a minimum grade point average of 6.00 to be awarded a Minor in that discipline.
- 19.5 A student may cover these six subjects as either a depth subject, elective subject or a breadth subject or as additional credits. However, he/she has to take at least three subjects as additional credits to earn a minor.
- 19.6 Students enrolled in Dual Degree, Integrated M.Sc. and B.Arch. (Hons.) are permitted to pursue minor in other discipline up to their 10th Semester, while

the students of B.Tech.(Hons.) should complete the minor requirements by 8th semester.

19.7 The students can register for Minor with EAA as backlog (Senate Item 322.H.I.C.6). .

# 20. Micro – Specialization

The Institute offers Micro-Specializations to UG students from the Spring Semester of the current Academic Session (2014-2015). The salient features are as follows:

- 20.1 Each Micro-Specialization has a defined structure in terms of three sequential components:
  - 20.1.1 Component-I One Foundation Course (2-4 credits) that constitutes a Mandatory Requirement and also a Pre-Requisite for subsequent Components.
  - 20.1.2 Component-II- One/Two subjects (3-4 credits each) from a Specified list of subjects.
  - 20.1.3 Component-III- Project/Design/Term Paper (4 credits) OR one subject (4 credits) from a Specified list.
- 20.2 A Student would be required to complete 3-4 subjects (10-14 credits) from the specified list in order to earn a Micro-Specialization.
- 20.3 The subjects can be taken through the Breadth/Open Elective component of the curriculum or as Additional Subjects. If specified in the Micro-Specialization curriculum, the subject can also be taken as Micro-Credit/s.
- 20.4 A student has to register for a Micro-Specialization. The Registration can be done in the beginning of any Semester beyond first year.
- 20.5 In order to register for a Micro-Specialization the student must have completed all curricular requirements upto the previous semester and have a CGPA ≥ 7.0. Thereafter the student must maintain a CGPA or SGPA ≥ 7.5 without any Backlog in the subsequent semesters to keep the Micro-Specialization registration active.
- 20.6 GPA for the subjects contributing to the Micro-Specialization will be separately calculated. A minimum GPA of 6.00 is essential to earn the Micro-Specialization.
- 20.7 The students can register for Micro-Specialization subjects with EAA as backlog (Senate Item 322.H.I.C.6).

# 21. Admission to Ph.D. for Joint M.Sc. - Ph.D. Program

Students admitted to the 2 year M.Sc. of the Joint M.Sc.-Ph.D. program can either leave with the M.Sc. degree after the fourth semester or join the Ph.D. program if he/she satisfies the following rules:

- 21.1 The student must have secured a minimum CGPA of 8 at the end of the fourth semester. The students must express, in writing, his (or her) willingness to continue with Ph.D.
- 21.2 Successful Joint M.SC.-Ph.D. student will be awarded two degrees (M.Sc. and

Ph.D.) simultaneously. Hence a student shifting to the Ph.D. program will not be listed as a recipient M.Sc. degree in the following convocation. However, each such student will be the given final grade card of the 4-semester M.Sc. degree. If, after joining, a student exits the Ph.D. program, then the degree of M.Sc. will be awarded in the next convocation. In that case the student will be given provisional certificate at the time of discontinuing the program and the student will be admitted to the Degree in the next convocation.

- 21.3 All regulations for the Ph.D. program with regard to admission, enrollment, comprehensive examination, registration, and award of degree, etc. are applicable to these students.
- 21.4 Joint M.Sc.-Ph.D. student admitted to the Ph.D. program will be treated as Institute Research student and will receive assistantship as per the MHRD norms prevailing at the time admission to the Ph.D. program.
- 21.5 A scholarship of Rs.5,000/- (Rs.Five thousand only) per month for the first two years of M.Sc. program will be paid to the students who join the Ph.D. program. The final amount will be released after the Ph.D. registration.

```
Rules and Regulations Updated –July 2018 Page 22
```

registered credit in the semester inclusive of backlog subjects must not exceed 28.

- 22.6.5 For students repeating a year, the registered credit in a semester must not exceed 20 (Senate item 320.H.I.C.10) in consultation with Faculty Adviser and Head of the Department. However, on the recommendation of the Department and approval of the Dean (UGS), a student may be allowed to take maximum 23 credits. He/She may register for subjects of P grade along with backlog subjects, with total registered credit not exceeding the limit of 20/23 as the case may be.
- 22.6.6 The credits of Industrial Training, field Trips (GG and MI students), comprehensive viva voce and EAA should be excluded while calculating the 28 or 16 credit limits per semester for backlog/year repeating students.
- 22.6.7 In registration for a subject, prerequisite must be taken care of. Students may be allowed to take Departmental elective subjects instead of professional breadth electives.
- 22.6.8 Registration in the subjects of same slots will not be allowed.
- 22.6.9 Subject to availability, a student, irrespective of his/her level or discipline of study may be allowed to take a subject including an M.Tech. subject as an Elective, Breadth or Additional Subject Students who have a Backlog in a Breadth or an Elective may register in another Breadth or Elective. The Elective must be in the same group of Electives offered in the Semester concerned.
- 22.6.10 Final year students may be allowed to take prescribed credit and, in addition, maximum two backlog subjects in a semester provided he has a CGPA of 6.00 and above so that he/she can clear all requirements of the degree if otherwise there is no time clash.
- 22.6.11 Academically Weak Students:

Such students will be divided into two categories based on their Notional CGPA (calculated on the basis on Total Credit Taken)

A. A student having CGPA < 6.0

 B. A student who has more than two backlogs/unregistered subjects (regardless of CGPA).

The faculty advisors will set up a meeting date every month and it will be mandatory on the part of the students to attend these meetings. During the meeting the problems of student will be discussed and measures to improve their Academic Performance suggested. A report of these meetings must be recorded on ERP for each student.

The Academic Registration on ERP for all weak students shall be done through faculty advisor only.

### 22.6.12 Restriction limits on Registration for Academically Weak Students

Students will be divided into two categories based on their Notional CGPA (calculated on the basis on Total Credit Taken)

- Category 1: Students with CGPA >=6.0
- Category 2: Students with CGPA < 6.0

Registration limits will depend on the students' category and the following limits will be imposed based on the number of subjects:

- Category 1: No restriction on the number of subjects. The student, however, must register for the Backlog/Unregistered subjects first. A student may register for a maximum of 24 credits. In case of final year, where the normal credit loading itself is around 24 credits due to the Project component, a student may be allowed two backlogs over and above the prescribed credit limit of the semester.
- Category 2: The registered credit in a semester must not exceed 21 in consultation with Faculty Adviser and Head of the Department. However, on the recommendation of the Department and approval of the Dean (UGS), a student may be allowed to take maximum 23 credits. He/She may register for subjects of P grade along with backlog subjects, with total registered credit not exceeding the limit of 21/23 as the case may be.

The student must register for the Backlog/Unregistered subjects first. Students, in this category, will be allowed to register only for one Project at a time. The credit limit is inclusive of improvement subjects.

22.6.13 Special Case of Architecture (B.Arch.(Hons.) Program)

Students having backlogs in 6th semester shall not be prevented from being promoted to 5th year (due to their off‐campus one‐semester internship in 8th semester). The students, however, must register for the 6th semester backlog subjects first in their 10th semester. The 'restriction limits for registration', specified above, shall be applicable for such students also.

- 22.5 Students who have cleared all the curricular requirements upto the previous semester and obtained CGPA lower than 6.00 may be allowed, on the recommendation of the Head of the Department and the approval of the Dean (Undergraduate Studies), to re-register in one or more subjects in which he/she received 'P' grade(s), so as to improve his/her CGPA to 6.00 or above, provided that the subject(s) is/are otherwise being offered in that semester and there is no clash in the time table. The grade will be revised and recorded only if there is an improvement.
- 22.6 A student who has been debarred from appearing at an examination either (i) as per recommendation of the subject teacher for unsatisfactory attendance or (ii) by the Institute as a measure of disciplinary action or (iii) for adopting malpractice at an examination, and consequently awarded a grade 'X', may reregister for the subject(s) after the term of the debarment expires, provided that other provisions of this regulations do not prevent him.
- 22.7 With the concurrence of the Faculty Adviser a student may be allowed to change his/her registration of subjects within one week from the day of registration.
- 22.8 If eligible a student may be allowed to register in additional subjects, with the concurrence of the Faculty Adviser, within one week from the day of registration.

### 22.9 Interdisciplinary Dual Degree in Financial Engineering

Students who are facing time table clash with a Departmental Subject for taking Economics (HS20001) in Autumn Semester may register for the same in Spring Semester of 2nd year Dual Degree program.

### 23. De-registration

- 23.1 The student can be de-registered in a subject of a semester by the concerned teacher on the ground of poor attendance.
- 23.2 If a student does not have a minimum of 80% attendance in a subject, he/she can be de-registered from the subject at the discretion of the subject teacher.
- 23.3 Only one-time de-registration is permissible and no revocation of the deregistered subject is admissible, expect on genuine medical grounds.
- 23.4 Email Warning should be given to the students by the subject teacher prior to de-registration.
- 23.5 The de-registration process shall commence after the Mid-semester Examination. However, in case of projects (BTP and MTP for Dual Degree), comprehensive viva voce and Summer Training/Internship, there is no scope for de-registration by the concerned teachers.
- 23.6 The de-registration will stop two weeks before the commencement of the End Semester Examination (Senate Item 316.H.I.C.6).

### 24. Grading System

24.1 As a measure of students' performance a 7-scale grading system using the following letter grades and corresponding grade points per credit, as shown in Table 24.1 will be followed:

| Performance | Letter Grade | Grade point<br>Per Credit |
|-------------|--------------|---------------------------|
| Excellent   | EX           | 10                        |
| Very good   | A            | 9                         |
| Good        | B            | 8                         |
| Fair        | C            | 7                         |
| Average     | D            | 6                         |
| Pass        | P            | 5                         |
| Fail        | F            | 0                         |

Table 24.1

In addition, there shall be one grading symbol X used to indicate that the student is Deregistered/Debarred in that particular subject.

A Semester Grade Point Average (SGPA) will be computed for each semester. The SGPA will be calculated as follows:

$$
SGPA = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n} c_i g_i}{\sum_{i=1}^{n} c_i}
$$

where 'n' is the number of subjects registered and cleared for the semester, ' <sup>i</sup> c '

is the number of Credits allotted to a particular subject, and ' <sup>i</sup> g ' is the gradepoints carried by the letter corresponding to the grade awarded to the student for the subject. SGPA will be rounded off to the second place of decimal and recorded as such. The SGPA would indicate the performance of the student in the semester to which it refers.

24.2 Starting from the second semester at the end of each semester S, a Cumulative Grade Point Average (CGPA) will be computed for every student as follows:

$$
CGPA = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{m} c_i g_i}{\sum_{i=1}^{m} c_i}
$$

Where 'm' is the total number of subjects the student has registered and cleared from the first semester onwards up to and including the semester S,' <sup>i</sup> c ' is the number of Credits allotted to a particular subject ' <sup>i</sup> s ' and ' <sup>i</sup> g ' is the grade-point carried by the letter corresponding to the grade awarded to the student for the subject ' <sup>i</sup> s '. CGPA will be rounded off to the second place of decimal and recorded as such.

The CGPA would indicate the cumulative performance of the student from the first semester up to the end of the semester to which it refers.

The CGPA, SGPA and the grades obtained in all the subjects in a semester will be communicated to every student at the end of every semester.

For determining the inter se merit ranking of a group of students, only the rounded off values of the CGPAs will be used.

- From the batch of 2014-2015 onwards the calculation of SGPA and CGPA will be based on all the subjects registered.
- 24.3 When a student gets the grade 'F' in any subject during a semester, the SGPA and the CGPA from that semester onwards will be tentatively calculated, taking only 'zero point' for each such 'F' grade. After the 'F' grade(s) has/have been substituted by better grades during a subsequent semester, the SGPA and the CGPA of all the semesters, starting from the earliest semester in which the 'F' grade has been updated, will be recomputed and recorded to take this change of grade into account.
- 24.4 Conversion of CGPA into percentage Marks: In case of a specific query by students/employers regarding conversion of CGPA into percentage marks, the following formula will be adopted for notional conversion of CGPA into percentage marks. Formula : % Marks = CGPA\*10

### 25. Assessment of Performance

There will be continuous assessment of a student's performance throughout the semester and grades will be awarded by the subject teacher/co-ordination committee formed for this purpose.

| Rules and Regulations | Updated –July 2018 | Page 26 |
|-----------------------|--------------------|---------|
|                       |                    |         |

- 25.1 In general there shall be no rigid marks-to-grade linkage. Difficulty levels of the examinations, tests, assignments, viva-voce and other factors that contribute to the final marks are to be considered by the teacher/co-ordination committee of a subject while converting marks into letter grades.
- 25.2 (a) The grades F and EX are to be considered as bench mark grades.
  - (b) The range of cut-off marks below which a student would be assigned an 'F' grade is 30-35 for the theory component and 35-40 for the laboratory component, the exact cut-off marks is to be decided by the teacher/coordination committee.
  - (c) The exceptionally brilliant performance is to be assigned an 'EX' grade. Even the best student of any class needs to be good enough to be awarded the 'EX' grade.
  - (d)For subjects which have a laboratory component (P-component) along with the theory, to secure any grade higher than 'F' a student has to achieve individually more than the cut-off marks in both the theory component and the laboratory component. Separate marks, each out of 100 (hundred), in the theory component (L- & T- components) and the laboratory component are to be ascertained first. A composite mark for the subject out of 100 is then to be computed by taking appropriate contribution of theory component and the laboratory component as shown in Table 25.1:

| L-T-P | Credit | Theory (L-T component) | Laboratory (P-component) |
|-------|--------|------------------------|--------------------------|
| 4-0-6 | 8      | 50                     | 50                       |
| 3-0-6 | 7      | 40                     | 60                       |
| 4-0-3 | 6      | 70                     | 30                       |
| 3-1-3 | 6      | 70                     | 30                       |
| 1-0-8 | 6      | 20                     | 80                       |
| 3-1-2 | 5      | 80                     | 20                       |
| 3-0-3 | 5      | 60                     | 40                       |
| 3-0-2 | 4      | 75                     | 25                       |
| 2-0-3 | 4      | 50                     | 50                       |
| 1-0-5 | 4      | 25                     | 75                       |
| 2-0-2 | 3      | 70                     | 30                       |
| 1-0-3 | 3      | 30                     | 70                       |
| 1-0-2 | 2      | 50                     | 50                       |

Table : 25.1

 Once the numeric mark is obtained, the same is to be converted to letter grade following the guidelines given in Table : 25.2.

| Table :<br>25.2 |       |  |  |
|-----------------|-------|--|--|
| Marks Range (m) | Grade |  |  |
| m >= 90         | EX    |  |  |
| 80 <= m < 90    | A     |  |  |
| 70 <= m < 80    | B     |  |  |
| 60 <= m < 70    | C     |  |  |
| 50 <= m < 60    | D     |  |  |
| 40 <= m < 50    | P     |  |  |
| m < 40          | F     |  |  |

25.3 Large Class Assessment: In the case of a relatively large class and/or classes

where the performance level depicts more or less a normal distribution:

- (a) The average performance (around mean value of marks) is to be assigned 'C' grade. However, if by teacher's/co-ordination committee's perception the general level of the class is considered to be appreciably high, the average performance may be assigned 'B' grade.
- (b) All other marks to grade conversion are to be done relatively with respect to the average performance in between (but excluding) the F and EX grades, which have already been assigned, by choosing appropriate boundary marks between grades.
- (c) Normally, in a reasonably large class of students distribution of grades is expected to be as follows:

|         | Table : 25.3 |
|---------|--------------|
| Grade   | Distribution |
| EX      | <= 10%       |
| A       | 10 – 20 %    |
| B, C, D | 20 – 35 %    |
| P       | 10 – 25 %    |
| F       | < = 5 %      |

- 25.3.1 In the case where a student appears in the supplementary examination or attends summer quarter, the conversion from marks to grade would be done applying the same norm as was framed for the original class.
- 25.3.2 For classes where excessive bunching occurs resulting in almost all the marks tending to cluster into same category, conversion from marks to grade may be done using the Table 23.2, where 'm' stands for the marks obtained. However, the teacher may, on his/her perception of the difficulty level of assessment process undertaken, alter the boundary (cut-off) marks by +/- 5 marks.
- 25.3.3 For subject in which the theory component is greater than 1 (one), the subcomponents and the respective weights assigned to these are given below.

| Table : 25.4             |        |  |
|--------------------------|--------|--|
| Subcomponent             | Weight |  |
| Teacher's Assessment     | 20%    |  |
| Mid-Semester Examination | 30%    |  |
| End-Semester Examination | 50%    |  |

- 25.3.4 For assigning marks in Teacher's Assessment (T.A.) performance in home assignments, class-tests, tutorials, viva-voce, attendance etc., are to be considered. At least two class tests are to be conducted for a subject. The weights of different sub-components of T.A. are to be announced by the teacher at the beginning of the Semester.
- 25.3.5 For subjects in which the theory component is 1 (one), there would be no Mid-Semester or End-Semester Examinations. The marks of the

theory component would be decided by performance in class-tests, home assignments, tutorials (if any), viva-voce, attendance etc. At least two class tests are to be conducted for the theory component of such a subject. The weights of different subcomponents are to be announced by the teacher at the beginning of the Semester.

- 25.3.6 For assigning marks in the laboratory component (P-component) the relevant sub-components that are to be considered are day-to-day work, regularity, tests (at least two must be conducted), assignments, vivavoce etc. Percentage weights of the different sub-components in deciding the final marks are to be announced at the beginning of the Semester.
- 25.4 The eight-week industrial training undergone by the students in the summer vacation after the sixth semester would be assessed within five weeks after the commencement of the seventh semester. The students are required to submit a written report on the training received and give a seminar, on the basis of which a grade would be awarded. The students are also required to submit to the Head of the Department a completion certificate in the prescribed form from the competent authority of the organization where the training was received, without which he/she would not be assessed.

### 26. Assessment of Project Work

26.1 Performance in the various activities involved in the project would be assessed individually at the end of each semester in which it is being carried out as per the curriculum. The student is required to submit a written report at the end of the semester. The Head of the Department would appoint a project evaluation board for the purpose of assessment. The project evaluation board of the tenth semester for Dual Degree/Integrated M.Sc. program would include an external expert to be appointed by the Dean (Postgraduate Studies) /Dean (Undergraduate Studies), from a panel recommended by the Head of the respective Department. The different components of evaluation and the weights assigned to these components are depicted below:

| Table : 26.1 |
|--------------|
|--------------|

| Subcomponent                                        | Weight |
|-----------------------------------------------------|--------|
| Supervisor's assessment                             | 40%    |
| Project Report/Thesis (to be assessed by the board) | 20%    |
| Evaluation Board's assessment                       | 40%    |

The student is required to give a seminar on the project work done. The evaluation board would conduct the viva-voce. Dates for conducting the seminar and the viva-voce, to be held within ten days after the end-semester examination, would be announced in the academic calendar.

26.2 The grades for projects of 7th, 8th semesters for B.Tech. and 9th, 10th semesters for Dual Degree/Integrated M.Sc. have to be submitted within the respective deadline of grade submission as per Academic Calendar. If a student cannot complete the project for any reason, by deadline, he/she will get an 'F' grade. The

| Rules and Regulations | Updated –July 2018 | Page 29 |

- BTP-I will be of 3 credits and BTP-II will be of 6 credits.
