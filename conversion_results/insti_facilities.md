Collect the office order the next day from Mr. Hazra. You have to submit a copy to CDC if there were CDC conflicts in Step 1.   // Keep this very carefully, as it is the only proof of a confirmed booking. # End. You have successfully booked the desired venue. All you have to do now is show up at the event with the Office Order. * Step 4: # '''Letter''' - Draft a letter addressing the '''The Registrar''' requesting to book the required venue, stating the time, date and purpose.  # '''Signature''' -  The letter would need the signatures of the present '''Governor''' of the society as well as that of the '''President''' of the '''Gymkhana''' in case of a Gymkhana society or just any '''Professor''' would also do.

A Lady is there who would check if the venue is available on the dates contemplated.  # If the dates are not available, go to '''Step 0'''. # If verification is successful, proceed to '''Step 6'''. * Step 6: # '''Office Order''' - Give the letter at the Establishment Section itself. There is no need to go to the Dean or any other person. Give it to the Lady there. Collect the '''office order''' the next day from the Establishment Section.   // Keep this very carefully, as it is the only proof of a confirmed booking. # End.
