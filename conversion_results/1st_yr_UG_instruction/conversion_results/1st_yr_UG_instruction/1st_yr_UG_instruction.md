## Instruction to 1st year UG Students

### Dedicated to the service of the Nation

The Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur (IIT Kharagpur) is a public engineering institution established by the government of India in 1951. It is the first of the IITs to be established, and is recognized as an Institute of National Importance by the Government of India.

### Motto

The motto of IIT Kharagpur is "Yoga Karmashu Kaushalam". This literally translates to "Excellence in action is Yoga", essentially implying that doing your work well is (true) yoga. This can be traced to Sri Krishna's discourse with Arjuna in the Bhagavad Gita. The quote, in the larger context of the Gita, urges man to acquire equanimity because a mind of equanimity allows a man to shed distracting thoughts of the effects of his deeds and concentrate on the task before him. Equanimity is the source of perfection in Karmic endeavors that leads to Salvation.

### 9. Change of Branch (At the end of First Year)

Change of the branch is a privilege and not a right. Only those students admitted to B.Tech.(Hons.) / Dual Degree / Integrated M.Sc. Programs through JEE(Advanced) are eligible to be considered for a change of branch after the Second (Spring) Semester . Students may enlist up to TEN (10) choices of branch, in order of preference, to which they wish to change over.

Change of branch shall be made strictly on the basis of inter se merit of the applicants. For this purpose the CGPA obtained at the end of the Second (Spring) Semester shall be considered. Ties will be broken by the JEE Advanced rank of the applicants.

- (a) In making the change of branch, those applicants shall be first considered who have secured a rank within top 1% (one percent), rounded to the nearest integer, amongst all the first year students in terms of the CGPA scored at the end of the Second (Spring) Semester. Change of branch requested for by such applicants shall be made without any constraint on the number of seats.
- (b) The remaining applicants may be allowed a change of branch, strictly in order of inter se merit, subject to the limitation that the actual number of students in the Third (Autumn) Semester, in the branch to which the transfer is to be made, does not exceed 110% of the sanctioned yearly intake for that branch.

### 10. Switch Over to Interdisciplinary Dual Degree

Students admitted to the 4-year B. Tech.(Hons.) / 5-year Dual Degree Program through JEE(Advanced) are eligible for Switch Over to the Dual Degree Programs of Engineering Entrepreneurship/Financial Engineering.

Such students must have completed all the prescribed course work for the first two Semesters in first attempt with a minimum CGPA of 6.00.

An option for Interdisciplinary Dual Degree Programs does not prevent a student to opt for Change of Branch. In such case Change of Branch allotted to a student would prevail over the option of Interdisciplinary Dual Degree Program.

### 11. B.Tech.(Hons.) to Dual Degree Switch Over

Third year B.Tech.(Hons.) students will have the option to switch over from 4-year B.Tech.(Hons.) to an existing 5-year Dual Degree course (one-way and not the reverse) in the same department, including a choice of specialization, offered at 2-year M.Tech. level in the Department maintaining proportionate distribution of seats.

The student must have completed all the curricular requirements upto sixth semester and must not have any backlog subjects with a minimum CGPA of 6.00.

### 12. Options for Dual Degree Specialization

Third year Dual Degree students of Agricultural and Food Engineering, Civil Engineering, Electrical Engineering, Electronics & Electrical Communication Engineering and Mechanical Engineering must exercise their choice of particular M.Tech. specialization.

### 13. Additional credits

From the THIRD semester onwards (including 2yr MSc Students, SENATE: 329.H.I.C.5) the curriculum offers scope for a student to opt for Additional subjects apart from the regular curriculum requirement.

#### 14. Micro-Credits

Micro-Credit courses are one credit courses having duration of 3-14 days offered during the semester or during evening or free slots available during weekdays or even weekends that are not declared holidays in some special cases when students are available.

The subject will be counted for total credit requirement for completion of degree in special cases subject to recommendation of the Head and approval of Dean (UGS) with due reasons recorded.

The subject and grade will be mentioned in transcript / grade card and will be used to compute CGPA for additional subjects and will be shown as ACGPA.

#### 15. Minor in a Discipline

A department would offer a MINOR in a discipline in which it offers a major.

The department would enlist a set of subjects from its curriculum and prescribe a requirement for minor taking six subjects or more (18-24 contact-hours plus 3-9 hours of laboratory) from this set. The subjects would be a combination of mostly core and some electives.

Only those students, who have a CGPA of 7.5 or above, without any Backlog, will be permitted to register for a Minor in the beginning of the 5th semester. An SGPA or CGPA in excess of 8.0 has to be maintained in the subsequent semesters without any Backlog in order to keep the Minor registration active. Should both the SGPA and CGPA fall below 8.0 at any point after registering for the minor; the Minor registration will cease to be active.

A student registered for Minor in a discipline must register and pass in all subjects that constitute the requirement for a minor and score a minimum grade point average of 6.00 to be awarded a Minor in that discipline.

A student may cover these six subjects as either a depth subject, elective subject or a breadth subject or as additional credits. However, he/she has to take at least three subjects as additional credits to earn a minor.

### 16. Micro – Specialization

The Institute offers Micro-Specializations to UG students from the Spring Semester of the current Academic Session (2014-2015). The salient features are as follows:

Each Micro-Specialization has a defined structure in terms of three sequential components: Component-I – One Foundation Course (2-4 credits) that constitutes a Mandatory

- Requirement and also a Pre-Requisite for subsequent Components.
- Component-II- One/Two subjects (3-4 credits each) from a Specified list of subjects.
