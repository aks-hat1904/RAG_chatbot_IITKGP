|==Foreword==  Technology Students’ Gymkhana is the hub of the numerous extra-curricular and cocurricular activities ranging from sports to music. The Gymkhana is managed by the students, for the students, under the guidance and active participation of the faculty and staff members. Any extensive system of operation needs to be guided by rules, regulations and a constitution. The constitution of the Gymkhana was drafted in 1952 and was revised in 1974. With rapid changes occurring on various fronts in the Institute, the students have felt the need for some revisions of the constitution to reflect the changed condition. Professor S.C.Roy, the present President of the Gymkhana requested Professor Y.P.Singh. an old alumnus and presently a Professor of the Institute to examine the document and to propose revisions. After discussion with the Deans and the concerned student office bearers, the final revised version of the condition is presented here. I must acknowledge my gratitude to Professor Y.P. Singh and others who have contributed to the revised Constitution. I hope this Constitution will serve to heighten the involvement and commitment of the students to the Gymkhana activities.  <poem> ( K. L. Chopra ) Director, IIT, Kharagpur & Rector Technology Students’ Gymkhana </poem>  ==Preamble==   The Constitution of the Technology Students’ Gymkhana was drawn in the year 1952, and subsequently revised in 1974. The basic structure and philosophy of the Gymkhana as envisaged by the founding fathers of the Institute have stood the test of time, and have been instrumental in contributing to the all round development of the IITians during the last four decades.  However, substantial structural changes during the last two decades have necessitated some modifications in the Constitution of the Technology Students’ Gymkhana. The proposed amendments have been evolved through detailed discussions with a broad cross section of the students and the academic community over a prolonged period, and aim to further enhance the role of the Technology Students’ Gymkhana in aiding its members in the cultivation of their interests in co-curricular and extra-curricular activities. The major changes are in respect of the following:  #Structural adjustments in the composition of various Committees and Subcommittees for providing a greater degree of initiative to the Secretaries through a greater degree of decentralization. The Executive Committee has been redesignated as the Executive Council to reflect these changes. #The Students’ Senate has been given its due recognition as an advisory body to the Vice-President on various matters relating to the Halls of Residence, disciplinary issues and general welfare of the student body. #The Students’ Court would fulfill a long felt void and would promote the growth of a more responsible and more self confident student body. #The functions of the Modelling Sub-committee have been redefined. This sub-committee would organize the Hobby Club and shall, in collaboration with the Nehru Technology Museum, organize an Inter-hall Modelling Competition in order to provide a new dimension and to give a fillip to the creative potential of the members of the Technology Students’ Gymkhana.  It is fervently hoped that these suggested amendments would make the Technology Students’ Gymkhana instrumental in playing a more positive and vibrant role in adding many more dimensions to the multifaceted talents of the members.  <poem> Kharagpur                                                                     ( YASH PAL SINGH ) March 17, 1993                                                 Professor of Electrical Engineering </poem>  ==Constitution Of The Technology Students’ Gymkhana==  INDIAN INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY Kharagpur – 721302   ===1.
