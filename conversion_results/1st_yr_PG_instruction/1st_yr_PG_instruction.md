# **Guidelines and Instructions for newly admitted students through JAM 2023**

#### *Dedicated to the service of the Nation*

The Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur (IIT Kharagpur) is a public engineering institution established by the [government](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_India) of India in 1951. It is the first of the [IITs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Institutes_of_Technology) to be established, and is recognized as an Institute of National Importance by the Government of India.

### **Motto**

The motto of IIT Kharagpur is "Yoga Karmashu Kaushalam". This literally translates to "Excellence in action is Yoga", essentially implying that doing your work well is (true) yoga. This can be traced to Sri Krishna's discourse with Arjuna in the Bhagavad Gita. The quote, in the larger context of the Gita, urges man to acquire equanimity because a mind of equanimity allows a man to shed distracting thoughts of the effects of his deeds and concentrate on the task before him. Equanimity is the source of perfection in Karmic endeavours that leads to Salvation.

### **Mission**

### **Vision**

Our Vision is
