|==<big>Introduction</big> ''' '''                    == 180 Degrees Consulting is the world’s largest organisation for non-profits and social enterprises with operations in more than 35 countries. The IIT Kharagpur branch of 180 Degrees Consulting (abbreviated as 180DC) was founded in April 2020 by Amritash Bharadwaj, Nikita Kishore, Adarsh Gupta, Aniket Shah and Keshav Godala with an aim to provide quality consultancy services to socially conscious corporations and NGOs to help them achieve the impact they seek to create.  Being students of the oldest, largest and most versatile of IITs, the team consists of driven and capable people with diverse skill sets across various fields. It is a platform where students can gain leadership skills, consulting experience and professional etiquette with a chance to derive value through the quality of their collaborative work.  ==<big>Functioning</big>    ==  ==='''Selections'''  === Selection procedures for 180DC are held at the start of the autumn semester. New recruits are taken in from second year only. The selection procedure consists of multiple rounds of interviews and discussions wherein prospective members aren’t judged on their knowledge of consultancy frameworks, but rather their problem-solving approach and whether they are able to present their thoughts in a structured manner.     The selection procedure evaluates the candidates on '''Structured Thinking, Problem Solving, Work Ethic, Time Management, Speaking, Writing and Design skills'''. Good knowledge of business and finance is appreciated but is not the main factor of evaluation. We expect an optimal amount of time and dedication.   ==='''Knowledge Meetings'''=== The main opportunity to learn in 180 Degrees Consulting is via knowledge meetings. Seniors organise knowledge meetings to polish the skills of new recruits and also teach them various consulting techniques and frameworks. These knowledge meetings also involve case study competitions/workshops.  ==='''Organisational Structure'''===  *'''Advisors''' consist of fourth and fifth-year members and are the senior-most members whose experience helps in guiding the overall direction of the organisation.  *'''Directors''' are members who are in their third and fourth year of study. They are responsible for heading various different portfolios and projects within the organisation.  *'''Senior Consultants''' are the members who are in their second and third year of study. They are responsible for executing the portfolio and project work assigned by the Directors.  *'''Consultants''' comprises the students who are in the second year. They take care of executing various plans and projects of 180DC  ==='''Advisors and Directors'''===  ===='''Advisors (2020-2021)'''====  *Amritash Bharadwaj ( Founder ) *Nikita Kishore  ===='''Directors (2020-2021)'''====  *Adarsh Gupta *Aniket Shah *Keshav Godala  ===='''Advisors (2021-2022)'''====  *Amritash Bharadwaj ( Founder ) *Nikita Kishore *Adarsh Gupta *Aniket Shah *Keshav Godala  ===='''Directors (2021-2022)'''====  *Aneeta James *Bhavik Jain *Divyansh Dewra *Gauranshi Chauhan *Harshal Dupare *Himanshu Dang *Ishan Das *Tanishq Bansal  ==<big>Our Work</big>==  ===Projects=== The organisation’s work includes client negotiation, acquisition, onboarding and providing consultancy services to clients.

PM school is an organisation that provides programmes for aspiring project managers which include live classes and case studies. 180 Degrees Consulting with the help of PM school had organised a workshop which involved giving tips and suggestions on how to crack project management interviews and also described the work of a project manager in a corporate company. Along with this 180DC also organised a product-case competition, in which a total of 200+ students took part.  __NOTOC__ __NOEDITSECTION__ [[Category:Societies and clubs]]  <big>AGV (Autonomous Ground Vehicle) is a multi-disciplinary research group under [[Debashish Chakravarty"|Prof. Debashish Chakravarty]], Mining department, aiming to build a fully operational self-driving car. It deals with varied projects involving computer vision,deep and reinforcement learning.</big>  [[Category: Societies and clubs]]  <big>AGV participates in Intelligent Ground Vehicle Competition ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligent_Ground_Vehicle_Competition IGVC]) every year. This year they are also participating in Mahindra Rise Prize Driverless Car Challenge. The team in divided in embedded electronics, software and mechanical parts.</big>  == <big>Vision</big> ==  <big>"Our vision is to have the world without road accidents; a place where people can commute without fear, to build the world’s most advanced and cost effective self-driving car."</big>  * <big>The present transportation system is getting increasingly expensive and inefficient.</big>  * <big>Over $230 billion are spent on car crashes every year, a majority of which are due to human errors.</big> * <big>Congestion in total amounts to 10.5 billion litres of wasted petrol each year.</big> * <big>Over 4.2 billion hours are wasted in traffic every year.</big> * <big>There has been an increase in the number of accidents due to human errors such as drinking and driving.</big> <big>The solution to all these problems is a self-­driving car. With this inspiration, we have started Autonomous Ground Vehicle (AGV) Research Group in IIT Kharagpur. We aspire to make India’s first fully operational self-driving car.</big>  <big>IGVC (Intelligent Ground Vehicle Challenge) has a huge international media coverage. Being such a consistent performer and from the esteemed IITs we will attract the attention of both the International Media, as well as Newspapers and Magazines within the country. We will ensure that due credit is given to all our sponsors, and our vehicle will have your desired logo as well.</big>  <big>The vehicle will be showcased at Kshitij, the Tech-Fest of IITKharagpur, which has a participation of 25,000 from outside Kharagpur. Other than Kshitij, we will showcase the vehicle at a variety of robotics exhibitions and workshops held throughout India. Additionally, the photo of the vehicle with the sponsors will be circulated all over the internet as well. Our team website would contain your company’s logo for the whole one year.</big>  <big>IIT Kharagpur has immense talent of students and it will be mutually beneficial for the company to collaborate with us in order to attract more talent for their company.</big>  === <big>Mahindra Rise Prize</big> === <big>India has been on the verge of greatness for too long. It's time to change that. It’s time to make the world sit up and take notice. To create disruptive solutions that transform lives. To lead in enterprise and innovation. To see "Made in India" mean best in the world. This is Mahindra Rise Prize challenge aims at. We at AGV have been selected in the first round of this challenge and we are looking forward to applying our technology to a Mahindra Vehicle making it fully Autonomous.</big>  === <big>Intelligent Ground Vehicle Challenge</big> === <big>The IGVC offers a design experience that is at the very cutting edge of engineering education. It is multidisciplinary, theory-based, hands-on, team implemented, outcome assessed, and based on product realisation. It encompasses the very latest technologies impacting industrial development and taps subjects of high interest to students. Design and construction of an Intelligent Vehicle fit well in a two-semester senior year design capstone course, or an extracurricular activity earning design credit. The deadline for an end-of-term competition is a real-world constraint that includes the excitement of potential winning recognition and financial gain. Students solicit and interact with industrial sponsors who provide component hardware and advice, and in that way get an inside view of industrial design and opportunities for employment. Team AGV has been constantly participating in Intelligent Ground Vehicle Competition and making a mark.</big>   == <big>Our Achievements</big> ==  ==== <big>Performance at IGVC 2018 :</big> ==== * <big>A total of 43 teams across India, Japan, USA, Canada and Istanbul had registered for this prestigious navigation challenge.</big> * <big>Our team gave the best of the colleges which included the likes of University of British Columbia, Georgia Institute of Technology, Michigan-Ann Arbor University, Ohio University etc., a run for their money.</big>  * <big>7 teams from India contested in it including those from IIT Madras and IIT Kanpur. Team AGV finished as Runner-Up, winners being team CART Inc. at Bluefield State College, USA.</big>  ==== <big>Our Products :</big> ==== * <big>We have developed our own series of Autonomous Cars called ‘Eklavya’. Over the years we have put out Eklavya, Eklavya 2.0, 3.0 and 4.0. Along with this we are developing Auro 666 and a 3D mapping API.</big> * <big>We cleared the first three stages of Mahindra Rise Prize Driverless Car Challenge and have been awarded a Mahindra E2O electric car, which is being worked upon to be made driverless. The project has received a lot of media coverage and is one of the first steps by any Indian Company to promote the research and development in autonomous technologies.</big>  == <big>Research Applications</big> ==  ===<big>Mine Mapping</big>=== <big>The lack of accurate maps of underground mines frequently causes mine accidents. Hazardous operating conditions and difficulty in access makes Robotic Exploration and Mapping an immediate and safe choice.The mapping algorithms used in the self-driving car can also be applied for mines.</big>  ===<big>Construction Mapping</big>=== <big>Large-scale construction projects might involve exploration of areas inaccessible or life­ threatening to workers. For such scenarios, a portable mapping solution could be hosted on a small flying quadrotor.</big>  ===<big>City Mapping</big>=== <big>The traditional surveying techniques for generating maps for city­ planning requires thousands of man-hours and are very expensive. Large cities can be mapped accurately and efficiently using a self-driving car equipped with 3­D laser mapping technologies. This can cut down on a lot of manual work and save time. With this view, we undertook the DIGITAL KGP PROJECT in which we mapped some parts of the IIT Kharagpur campus using the 3­D ENVIRONMENT MAPPING Technology.</big>  ===<big>Night Time Driver Assist</big>=== <big>The use of special sensors in autonomous driving systems can detect approaching vehicles and road boundaries under poor lighting conditions. This feature could be widely used in vehicles as an essential safety measure.</big>  ===<big>Lane Departure Warning System</big>=== <big>This system warns the driver as soon as the vehicle starts moving out of the lane. If the driver, for some reason, avoids the warning, the system takes over and moves the vehicle back into the lane. This technology completely removes the human error involved in the process.</big>  ===<big>Collision Detection System</big>=== <big>A sensing system has a wider field of view compared to an average human being. It is also capable of running calculations at over 2.5 GHz. Owing to these qualities, a sensing system can warn the driver beforehand about a probable collision.</big>  == <big>Completed Projects</big> == * <big>'''Motion Planning'''</big> * <big>'''Robot Perception'''</big> * <big>'''Object Detection'''</big> * <big>'''Localisation'''</big> * <big>'''Lane Navigation'''</big>  = Branding Avenues = * <big>Overnight hackathons and workshops in IIT Kharagpur</big> * <big>The product itself, merchandise worn by the team, banners, standees etc.</big>  * <big>15000+ reach through our Social Media, Youtube and GitHub Handles.</big> * <big>Research Papers and other technical publications.</big>  == <big>Sponsorship</big> == <big>We are currently receiving funds through the Sponsored and Industrial Consultancy Cell (SRIC), IIT Kharagpur to carry on our research. These funds have constraints. As the sensors and other high-end technologies are quite expensive and cannot be bought solely through the funds from SRIC the team has to find alternative and cheaper methods to achieve what they want to. These methods are usually more time-consuming and less efficient.</big>  <big>Also the funds from SRIC cannot be used to participate in IGVC, since the funding cannot be used in travel and logistics which in itself require huge budget. Even this time the team funded themselves and performed outstandingly. So we have rightly shown that on being supported we will definitely perform much better and efficiently.</big>  <big>One example of our use of latest technologies on our work is the use of Velodyne LiDAR sensors to autonomously drive the Mahindra E2O car, which was highly successful.</big>  == References == [https://agv-iit-kgp.github.io AGV IIT Kharagpur]   Ambar is the '''gender and sexual diversity resource group''' for the Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, Queer and Questioning ([[wikipedia:LGBT"|LGBTQ+]]) community residing in IIT Kharagpur Campus and/or officially associated with IIT Kharagpur.

Progress reaches the society only when change is observed.  Awaaz has tried to bring a change in the institute and students’ lives every then and now. Some of the initiatives have been described below:  '''Sting Operation on Passport Bribery Case:''' A common complaint of the police officers asking for bribes was reported by a lot of students. The bribe amount varied from around 200 to 500 rupees. Awaaz conducted a sting operation and recorded the incident stealthily. The recording along with the report of a survey conducted by Awaaz was submitted to the concerned authorities and bribery was almost curbed.  '''CV Module:''' When the ERP-based CV Module was newly introduced in the institute, the students faced a lot of problems due to the highly inefficient and buggy platform on which they were supposed to make their CV. Awaaz conducted a survey and prepared a report to submit to the administration. The report was considered by the administration and the CV Module was halted for a few days to come up with a better version of the same.  '''Security Issue:''' In 2016, the campus had way too less number of security guards and CCTV Cameras. The report submitted by Awaaz regarding the same was considered and led to a lot of changes on the security front in the campus.  '''Cleanliness Issue:''' On the behalf of the entire student community, Awaaz demanded an increase in the number of dustbins in the campus and use of steel dustbins instead of plastic ones. The struggle bore fruits and the requests were considered by the institute.  ==Events Conducted== Awaaz, IIT Kharagpur conducts two events in the span of one year:  '''Panch Parmeshwar:''' In the splendour of Spring Fest, Awaaz conducts ‘Panch Parmeshwar’, an event that attempts to bring the funniest and most delightful village memories back for the students.

'''Kavyanjali:''' Poets across the nation gather together for a poetic evening at the campus!  ==Selection Procedure== Selections to Team Awaaz are held once every year, for both first and second year students, in the month of August.

It provides a platform for like-minded individuals who yearn to enrich their knowledge of business and apply their skills in various competitions like case studies and hackathons at the national and international levels. A family of around 70 student members, actively working under 3 wings: '''Strategy, Finance, and Analytics''', BClub is constantly striving to bridge the gap between business and technology.  ==History== ===Founding=== Business Club was founded in 2009 as '''Genese-de-Strategie''' by Shailesh Gupta, Harsh Gupta, Srichandana Sanjeev, Sudipto Sannigrahi, and Mayank Mundra. Genesie-de-Strategie was started with a primary objective to educate the students about the world of business strategies. The founders felt a need for students to be informed about the working of the business world for their growth. Over the course of a year, they realised the need to have a more wholesome approach to the world of business. They formed the Business Club in 2010 with a broader perspective toward business. ===Growth===  *'''Indian Case Challenge,''' India’s largest case competition, is the flagship event of the Business Club. ICC now witnesses international participation as well. *'''Affiliation to Technology Students’ Gymkhana''' (during the academic session 2014-15) brought official recognition to the club. *The Business Club has started to reach out to the entire student population of the college by conducting '''Open House Sessions''' for their benefit. *Regular '''social media content''' and '''blogs''' in the domain of finance, strategy and analytics are uploaded on all major social media platforms to keep readers updated.  ==Functioning== ===Selections=== Selections to the Business Club are held at the beginning of the first and the second academic year.  ====First-year selections==== The selection procedure consists of a '''group-discussion''' round followed by a personal '''interview''' for the shortlisted candidates. Prospective members aren’t judged based on their business acumen, but on their ability to think clearly, present thoughts in a concise and structured manner, their dedication, and their zeal to learn.  ====Second-year selections==== A training period called the '''summer program''' is conducted for the students selected in the second academic year to level their knowledge with the students selected in the first year. During this time, they are provided with the same resources to learn everything necessary.   After the summer program, every associate is evaluated on the same knowledge level and a final personal interview is conducted to select the students with the highest knowledge in the three domains. Other soft skills like communication are also kept in mind. Selected students are then assigned the position of sub-heads.  ===Structure=== Business Club has a four-level organisational structure.  *'''Advisors''' consist of fourth and fifth-year members and are the senior-most members whose experience helps in guiding the overall direction of the club. *The executive body comprises of '''Governors''' and '''Heads''' who are in the third year of their study. They are responsible for heading various wings of the club and its management. *The team of '''Sub-heads''' is responsible for the day-to-day functioning of the club and the execution of its plans. It consists of students in the second year of their studies. *'''Associates''' are the first years who have a passion to win and are generally business-oriented. These members are oriented towards gaining as much knowledge as they can from the pool of knowledge available to the seniors.  <br />The functional structure of the Business Club consists of three wings – '''finance, analytics, and strategy'''. These wings include all that happens within the world of business.  ===Activities=== '''''Intra-Club activities'''''  To prepare the associates for the sub-head tenure, they are encouraged to participate in various activities to lay a strong foundation in the three domains of Analytics, Finance, and Strategy. These activities include:   *'''Intra-club case study Competition''' - The associate batch is divided into small groups and each team is allotted a sub-head as a mentor, who guides the associate batch in solving the problem statement. On the D-day, the executive batch judges the teams through their presentations, and valuable inputs are given. *'''Knowledge meets''' - Organising knowledge meetings is the way by which knowledge dissipation happens in the Club. These meetings are conducted by Club members, where they meet and brainstorm on various topics of interest. A strong network consisting of resourceful seniors and mentor professors clarifies any doubts the members may have and make the meetings fruitful. *'''Whitepaper -''' This event is organized so that the associates could choose and research the topic of their choice in the domain of the three wings of the B-club. During the event, Associates put around 20 days of research and at the end present their papers in front of the executive and sub-head Batch, where they give useful insights into the topic *'''Drafting modules and blogs -'''  Club members design modules and blogs in the three wings. These modules are released through the public handle.  *'''Summer program'''  During the Summer holidays, many first-years apart from the Associate Batch are selected for the program as Summer Associates.   #'''Case study competition''' - This is the second intra-club case study competition. This time associates are made to solve the problem statement on their own without the mentorship of seniors, considering they have already done the courses in the three domains. #'''Analytics competition''' - This competition concentrates on the core of machine learning. Associates are given a data set and this competition demands writing algorithms without using built-in libraries and maximizing the accuracy score on the given dataset. #'''Trading Competition -'''  During this competition Associates and Summer Associates create a mock trading account. This competition lasts for 10 days and associates carry out intraday trading based on the technical and fundamental analysis they have learned in the program.  At the end of the summer program, based on the performance and participation in the summer program, associates are selected to be the part of sub-head batch.   '''''Events organized by the Club'''''  The club conducts a wide range of activities such as open house sessions and case studies enabling students to develop their business acumen by applying their skills and finding solutions to real-world problem statements.  *'''''Indian Case Challenge'''''  Ever since its inception in 2012, the Indian Case Challenge provides the best platform for undergraduate and graduate students from all over India to compete against each other and prove their business and entrepreneurial mettle in a real-life business case scenario. Not only are the participants expected to have strong business skills and financial understanding, but also a feeling for entrepreneurship and a sense of realizing market opportunities.   ICC 2021, organized in association with Kshitij, was a huge success and received a whopping 3200+ unique registrations, including international participation.  *'''''Open House Sessions'''''  Business Club strives to impart basic knowledge regarding the various facets of business, in an attempt to make the students of IIT Kharagpur more equipped to thrive in the ever-evolving global industry. Open house sessions on basic finance, analytics, and strategy that are conducted in conjunction with organizations such as Alphabeta, ZS Associates, and IIMC Consulting Club have gone a long way towards this.  *'''''Webinars'''''  Informative webinars, presided by renowned speakers who excel in their respective business fields, are conducted by the club, to enrich the knowledge of the students even in online mode.  ==Governors and Heads==  ===2014-15===  *'''Governors''' **Sarthak Badjatiya **Shramajit Gupta **Virendra Singh *''' Heads''' **Analytics: Pranay Yadav **Consultancy: Pratyush Devliyal **Finance: Umang Mavani **Technical: Ravikiran Shinde  ===2015-16===  *'''Governors''' **Ashutosh Dwivedi **Nishant Jayaswal **Shiladitya Saha *'''Heads''' **Analytics: Raunak Chitlangia, Shubhrit Agrawal **Consultancy: Manik Aggarwal **Finance: Dhruva Ratanpura **Technical: Murtaza Phalasiya, Rajat Bhavnani **Logistics: Rihen Chheda, Ritwik Bajaj  ===2016-17===  *'''Governors''' **Priya Mehta **Kumar Sparsh **Udit Sarin *'''Heads''' **Analytics: Charu Agarwal, Shwetha Krishnamurthy **Finance: Debjyoti Chakrabarti **Consultancy: Medha Asija **Technical: Shubham Singhal, Vaibhav Chauhan  ===2017-18===  *'''Governors''' **Harsh Agarwal **Hitendra Pratap **Shubhra Agrawal  *'''Heads''' **Analytics: Ankit Agarwal, Subham Rajgaria **Finance: Ankit Agarwal, Rajat Ragha, Shubham Sharma **Strategy: Shubham Maheshwari **Blogs and Articles: Rahul Raj **Design: Anjali Bharti  ===2018-19===  *'''Governors''' **Aman Sharma **Nikita Kishore  *'''Heads''' **Analytics: Yash Jain **Finance: Amandeep Singh, Puneet Pansari **Strategy: Amit Gunjan, Yogshree Choukse  ===2019-20===  *'''Governors''' **Aditya Parashar **Deepankar Sachdeva  *'''Heads''' **Analytics: Amrit Goswami, Chinmay Singh, Karan Mahajan **Finance: Shreyansh Jain, Vikrant Gupta **Strategy: Tushar Mohandas, Tushar Singla **Technical: Aditya Singhania  '''<big>2020-21</big>'''  *'''Governors''' **Aryan Saxena **Lakshraj Doshi **Shashank Singh  *'''Heads''' **Analytics: Arusarka Bose, Naman Paharia, Abhinav Bohra **Finance: Sayantan Das, Lakshiyata Chhajer, Amur Khandelwal **Strategy: Shivam, Gaurav Joshi, Inakshi Kar  ===2021-22===  *'''Governors''' **Arya Uttamchandani **Sankalp Bose  *'''Heads''' **Analytics: Karan Uppal, Dikshant Pratap Singh **Finance: Arnav Bhutda, Suhas Jain, Aditya Saha **Strategy: Tejaswi Pagadala, Kashish Lundia **Web: Piyush Dhamane **Branding and Public Relations: Deepansh Agrawal  ==='''2022-2023'''===  *'''Governors''' **Madiha Hanifa **Bharat Uday *''' Heads''' **Analytics: Vaibhav Jalani **Strategy: Siddharth Madupathi, Pragya Choudhary **Finance: Ram Sundaram, Patel Yuti **Web and Design: Sai Kalyan Meghavath  === 2023-2024 ===  *'''Governors''' **Siddharth Dikshit **Shreeya Mishra  *'''Heads''' **Analytics: Adyan Rizvi, Ishan Ray, Lokesh Tirthani **Finance: Suryaansh Jindal, Ojasvi R Singh **Strategy: Atmajyoti Ghosh, Arya Vardhan Singh, Jash Mody  === 2024-2025 ===  *'''Governors''' **Arnav Bansal **Anshul Trehan  *'''Heads''' **Analytics: Arya Dighde **Finance: Aman Samriya, Manya S.

in 1979 by Mr. Rippan Kapur and 6 friends to improve the condition of the underprivileged Indian child. CRY IIT Kharagpur Volunteer Chapter was started on 6th April, 2010  under the leadership of Ramanuj Lal and Monish Salhotra to bring about a change in the lives of the deprived children in and around their campus and formed CRY IIT Kharagpur Volunteer Chapter. CRY IIT Kharagpur Chapter is a group volunteers with a passion to improve the lives of children of our society, specially around Kharagpur. The Chapter functions under CRY Kolkata Regional Office.    == History ==  === Child Rights and You ===  As per [https://www.cry.org/history CRY's website] "Way back in the 1970s, Rippan Kapur, a young airline purser, was driven by the extraordinary dream to see a day when no Indian child would be deprived of rights as basic as survival, participation, protection and development. Like many of us, Rippan too was upset when he saw disparities between privileged and underprivileged children. He hated to see children begging and working as servants. Unlike most of us though, he did something about it. He joined his school’s social service club and read to the blind, visited children in hospitals, held reading and writing classes for street children, and started a free dispensary at a slum the club adopted. To raise funds for these activities, the club sold milk. It even won a shield for the best Interact club! These qualities of resourcefulness and determination came in handy. [[File:CRY team.jpg"|thumb"|340x340px"|CRY IIT Kharagpur Volunteer Chapter Team]] In 1979 Rippan and 6 friends started CRY with Rs 50 around his mother’s dining table. They felt that something needed to be done to improve the situation of the underprivileged Indian child. Uncharacteristically, given their backgrounds and motivations, they chose not to start a grassroots-level implementing organisation working directly with and for underprivileged children. They opted instead to make CRY a link between the millions of Indians who could provide resources and thousands of dedicated people and organisations at the grassroots-level who are struggling to function for lack of them. This “link” or enabling position has determined CRY’s strategic choices at every juncture – from the fundraising methods it employs, to the nature of its relationship with the NGOs it partners with."  === IIT Kharagpur Chapter === To bring a change was the thought of a handful of students of IIT Kharagpur, in March 2010. They joined hands under the leadership of Ramanuj Lal and Monish Salhotra to bring about a change in the lives of the deprived children in and around their campus and formed CRY IIT Kharagpur Volunteer Chapter. With the help of Saptak Mohanta, a former intern at CRY Kolkata and few other motivated acquaintances, a strategic team was formed. It has gradually become a decent group of students from various fields of engineering, science, law and MBA. The initiative was flagged off with the launch of a photography contest in the campus which witnessed participants submitting their entries on issues of child rights in and around their campus which often remains unnoticed.  == Beliefs == CRY does not believe in running schools or orphanages or initiating vocational training. CRY believes in permanent change, policy level and implementation level change, so that the change impacts millions of children, is permanent or long term in nature, the children do not have to depend on NGOs for their welfare and it does not substitute the role of the state in ensuring child rights.  == Awards and Achievements ==  === Achievements === We, under the IIT Kharagpur Volunteer Chapter, have taken some initiatives like Mid-day meal project, Barrier-Free IIT Kharagpur project etc. Our biggest achievements till date are:  1. Successfully catalyzing implementation of Mid-Day Meal in Mirpur Adivasi Primary School along with recruitment of new teachers.  2. Included as a part of the 'Committee for the welfare of Physically Challenged students of IIT Kharagpur'.  3. Conducted an Access Audit of IIT Kharagpur, with instructions from the Dean (UGS) and submitted a report that resulted in infrastructural changes in the campus including building of ramps.  4. Conducted numerous RTE campaigns to promote Right to Education Act and other education related policies.  5. Organized two international photography competition entitled Focus Right to promote child rights.  6. Team "Project Baalrakshak" conducts Awareness cum Workshop on Child Sexual Abuse for the children and their parents in assistance with Paschim Medinipur District Police. Under this project till date 84 sessions are being conducted in 20 schools were children from nursery to class XII participated, also 32 sessions were conducted with the parents of those children. Till date around 5352 children and parents have attended the sessions. Project Baalrakshak has been recognized by Kharagpur Municipality.  === Awards === Team "Project Baalrakshak" has secured "3rd Prize" for presenting "Poster" regarding the work on "Child Sexual Abuse" in "2nd International Workshop (The Science of Happiness) - Happiness and Wellbeing: The Road Beyond" which was conducted by Rekhi Centre of Excellence for the Science of Happiness at IIT Kharagpur from 4-6 April 2019.  == Activities == CRY IIT Kharagpur Chapter has various activities occurring on a regular basis.  === Project Baalrakshak === [[File:Project Baalrakshak session.jpg"|thumb"|397x397px"|Project Baalrakshak founder, Mr. Rajarshi Debnath, taking a session with adults about child sexual abuse.]] From Mars Orbital Missions to Curiosity Rover, from breathtaking researches in Artificial Intelligence to audacity in medical technology, from astonishing expeditions in the deepest of the oceans to lofty skyscraping infrastructures, the humanity has arrived at its dawn where the development had never earlier reached and sustained this great pace that it has now, the global economy has never been so stable, survival has never been such a duck soup. But even for all these things, where are we still? Sometimes, we fear and wonder if in times like these, will childhood be as gleeful and enjoyable. But, unfortunately, that is the least of the worries we can think of.  According to the statistics, one of the surveys sampled over more than 45,000 children in the age group 12-18, across different states of the country, revealed that half of the children were victims of child sexual abuse in one way or another. Adding to it, the taboo and fear of society are still ingrown in the people as one in four cases of child sexual abuse goes unreported. Victims of child sexual abuse are about four times more likely to develop symptoms of drug abuse and experience PTSD as adults and are about three times more likely to experience a major depressive episode as adults. POSCO Act which defines a child as any person below the age of 18 years and provides protection to all children under the age of 18 years from the offenses of sexual assault, sexual harassment and pornography was passed in the parliament in 2012, but still as we can see from the stats, we are far from making our country, in all its truest forms, safe for children.  Moved by these atrocities and himself being a survivor of child sexual abuse, Rajarshi Debnath, a research scholar and a thoroughly motivated volunteer in CRY IIT Kharagpur Volunteer Chapter, now also a recipient of iVolunteer awards came up with a little thought of doing something for the children, trying to prevent child sexual abuse by making people aware of it. This small idea was named "Project Baalrakshak." It all started two years back, in 2016. This idea of Child Sexual Awareness Workshops, as prolific as it did sound was challenging in all its means. It was a hard task to get suitable enough volunteers who could be dedicated and deliver the sensitive content appropriately and convincingly to the audience which was to comprise of children from classes nursery to 12th, parents and teachers. Tackling with all these issues the first workshop was eventually conducted in Balrampur high school in Kharagpur in September 2016. Though, there still were many troubles, Rajarshi stood unfaltered, finally getting a very dedicated team of his own, with the help which Project Baalrakshak has now gained widespread fame, from making his founder Rajarshi Debnath, a finalist in iVolunteer Awards 2019 to gaining assistance from Mednipur District Police, getting featured in a total of 22 print and digital media, and reaching around 5200 children, parents/guardian in a total of 19 schools, in its two years of working period. Team Project Baalrakshak also received a letter of appreciation from the Ward Counselor of Kharagpur. [[File:Project Baalrakshak.jpg"|thumb"|396x396px"|A Project Baalrakshak session teaching children about good touch and bad touch.]] As a result of Team Project Baalrakshak's attempts, many children and parents had finally broken down their silence and talked about sexual abuse that the children were a victim of. Furthermore, it was found that in 19% cases, culprits were unknown, 57 % were family friends/friends, 21 % close relatives, and 12 % school/tuition teachers, which to a large extent matches with the national reports. Earlier Team Project Baalrakshak had to approach schools and convince them for their sessions, but now for the success, they have attained in their field, they're now actively invited by schools for conducting sessions.   Team has conducted workshops in Kharagpur, Medinipur and Jhargram. This team is also featured in "LINK (LBSNAA Innovation NetworK)' which is a platform working to connect the needs of the field administrators to a wide audience of technology providers, innovators, skilled man-power ecosystems and finance sources.  Things don't change as swiftly as we sometimes want them to be, nevertheless they do remain in that state of stagnancy as it is for the sheer and consistent efforts of those around who seek to get the change, no matter what it takes and how it takes, their results will definitely mark the screen for both the upcoming and ongoing generations; seekers, believers and finally, achievers.  Currently, Team Project Baalrakshak is headed by Ms. Parama Mukhopadhyay and Mr. Turin Datta who took charge on February, 2019.   === School Sessions === [[File:Class session.jpg"|thumb"|210x210px"|A volunteer teaching children]] C.R.Y is an non profit and non government organisation working for the betterment and upliftment of the underprivileged children in India. We are the volunteers at the Kharagpur Chapter under C.R.Y., Kolkata where our mission is to develop the condition of the children around and inside the campus. The most active section of our chapter is the team who oversee the school sessions. Every Saturday, we go to middle schools at Arasini and Amlatoria where we teach and interact with the children from Classes I to IV. Our main aim is to cover the things which they otherwise are not able to do in their regular course curriculum. We cover things like basic maths, story telling, puzzles, games, science experiments, good food habits and importance of health. For the children at Amlatoria, with the efforts of the volunteers, we have successfully built a playscape at the school playground. We also have bought a projector for the school at Amlatoria and in pursuit of buying one more for the other one. We, as volunteers want that the children should learn good amount for moral and social etiquettes for a good and decent survival in this cut throat world. Then only will our long term goal will be achieved.  === Medical Camps === C.R.Y IIT Kharagpur Volunteer Chapter organises medical camps every year at Amlatoria and Arashini villages. Medical camps are organised to make basic healthcare accessible for all. These villages have no healthcare facilities or even a qualified healthcare worker. Majority of the people living in remote villages are daily wage labourers, who earn very meagre income. They don’t go hospital or get a health checkup even when they are sick. Because, their little income won’t be sufficient to afford to the costs of getting a good health checkup or buying the medicines the doctor has prescribed for them.  Medical Camp conducted last time was a huge success with more than 200 villagers attending the camp. A group 16 doctors were a part of this camp and they personal attention to everyone. Medicines were given free of cost.  === Science Exhibitions === [[File:Science Exhibition.jpg"|thumb"|149x149px"|An experience with virtual reality during a science exhibition.]] CRY IIT Kharagpur volunteer chapter conduct school sessions on a regular basis to motivate children for their better future. Education does not simplify mean the ability to read and write, So for the complete process of development, volunteers conduct science exhibition every academic year in which volunteers prepare various science models for children and present them to the children to explain and understand science practically. Science exhibition is mostly directed towards the basic science in daily life like respiration, fire burning, water absorption by plants. Volunteers made models to explain to the children the basic sciences to increase interest  and relate to their daily life so that they can understand easily.  === Community Meetings === Community meeting, a gathering in which we see a participation from the parents, guardians and other members of the society, we stand up to focus on the potholes, discuss about their causes and find solutions to them. Community levels on a village level mainly aims to bring in light the various issues that the children are facing and make the people aware of certain topics which might go neglected if unattended, but tend to have a big impact on the lives of children. Certain issues like sanitation,  basic child rights, menstruation, importance of mental health, safe drinking water, first aid methods, importance of basic education especially for girl child etc. need to be projected before the community to them aware of it as it indirectly helps children as they are the members of the community as well and if the community nourishes, children are defaulty the benefiitters. The contents discussed there is pre-prepared which is delivered by our volunteers in an overall interactive session.   In the Accupressure awareness community meeting, held at Arasini School, awareness was spread about the various acupressure points realizing that the people at the villages lack basic medication. Another meeting focussed on the menstrual health of women. People were made aware about what is menstruation and what kinds of problem women have during menstruations and their solutions were discussed. They came to know how the age old taboos have no scientific base and that the periods are completely normal, and any problem can be solved by correct consultation from the doctor and by maintaining hygiene. The latest meeting was based on the purity of water in the water sources around the village. There is a high possibility of them being contaminated by high arsenic content which is harmful for both humans as well as for the crops. Their harmful health effects, sources of contamination, methods of identification and filtration of water techniques were discussed in detail.  Such meetings provide an easy yet effective way for people to come together and discuss their problems and viewpoints and find solutions together for the betterment of the community as a whole. We at CRY, IIT Kharagpur are constantly putting efforts for more and more such meetings to solve as many problems as we can to bring a positive effect on their lifestyle and add meaning to their life.  === Child Labour Survey === Child rights and you is a non-profited organisation which works in different aspects of developing and protecting a child life by different means one of the aspect is to free the country from child labour. Child labour is the service paid by the children in their childhood in any field of work. This is done by the child own due to the lack of resources for the life survival, irresponsibility of the parents or forcefully by the owner for increasing their return on investment at low investment. It does not matter the cause of child labour as all the causes force children to live their life without childhood. Childhood is the great and happiest period of the lives of everyone during which one learns about the basic strategy of the life from parents, loved ones and nature. Child labour interferes with the proper growth and development of the children in all aspects like mentally, physically, socially and intellectually. The volunteers and members of cry IIT Kharagpur has dedicated there every dime of potential to make the IIT Kharagpur campus free of child labour and for that they have conducted many surveys inside the campus in different section and has made a stats to show that the campus of IIT Kharagpur is finally free of child labour. [[File:Playscape.jpg"|thumb"|A Playscape made with funds raised.]]  === Playscape === Childhood is the most beautiful part of our lives, full of fun, play and activities. But some children never get to see what a playground is. To give the chance of playing in a playground to the children of Amlatoria Primary School, CRY IIT Kharagpur Chapter organised a fundraiser to build a playground. The fundraiser started in the beginning of 2018, aimed to raise funds of Rs. 1,25,000 through the crowdsourcing platform, Ketto. The designs for the playscape were made by Anthill Creations and the playscape was made from tyres and other recyclable materials. The project had a support of 159 contributors who helped by donating to make this project a reality. The contributors included students and professors of IIT Kharagpur as well as many well wishers. Door-to-door as well as social media campaigns helped to draw contributors to this. Funds were also raised for this at the stall set up during Spring Fest, in order to reach people outside Kharagpur.  Since the playground has been constructed, children have a chance to play among various swings and mazes constructed on the ground. This play inculcates a feeling of curiosity, inquiry and adventure. Even now, the children are building memories on that playscape that they will cherish for a lifetime.  === Installation of Projector === [[File:Projector installed.jpg"|thumb"|230x230px"|Children watching content projected using the projector installed.]] We know that almost every child is getting education, but are they  getting proper education, with sufficient modern facilities? The answer is ‘no’. Still There are schools where students don’t get good quality education and not exposed to the outer world or current affairs in their own country Eg: who is the prime minister of India.The children need special guidance to know about all these things i.e. good communication skills and other parts of education like sciences etc.  Volunteers of  CRY IIT Kharagpur are trying to tackle this problem. One of the steps taken by these volunteers is using projector in the nearest government school named Amlathuri. Due to the poor facilities in the school children are not able to learn subjects well so volunteers of CRY IIT Kharagpur bought a projector and they are giving training to the teachers sing this projector the volunteers want show some videos of English stories(so that it would be helpful for their improvement in communication skills in English and some videos related to other subjects in their course). The teachers given training to use this projector so that in the absence of the volunteers they can use it and show the videos related to respective topic.    == Team == CRY IIT Kharagpur Chapter has members from all sections of IIT Kharagpur's Student Body including UG, PG and RS. Currently the administrative heads are Ashish Rathor (NA '20) and Vikram Chugh (CE '20)  == Social Media == CRY - Child Rights and You is an Indian Non Government Organisation that catalyses change in the lives of underprivileged children in India by restoring their rights.

It participates with consistent success in [[wikipedia:Parliamentary debate"|Parliamentary Debates]] across the world, and had organized the IIT Kharagpur Model United Nations Conference and the IIT Kharagpur Parliamentary Debate in previous years. In 2020, a team from KGP DebSoc went on to become '''the first all-Indian team to reach the ESL (English-as-Second-Language) finals of Australs''', one of the most prestigious debating tournaments in the world. In 2024, a team from KGP DebSoc emerged as the '''winners of ESL (English-as-a-Second-Language) finals of Uhuru Worlds''', one of the biggest and most prestigious international tournaments.  ==Campus events and tournaments== ===Selection process===   The Debating Society is always looking for smart, enthusiastic debaters, and takes in new members all year round. There is no restriction on the year of study, and members have joined as late as 4th year. However, to provide more structured training, and to spread awareness, it holds Fresher Selections and Senior Selections at the beginning of the year. This is followed by a training workshop, which lasts about a month, where newcomers to parliamentary debating are taught various facets and nuances of structured argumentation.  ===Regular activities=== The Debating Society tries to meet at least two times a week for practice sessions. These are usually conducted in the foyer of the Main Building, with multiple debates often happening around the place. University-level competitive debates have two preeminent formats - the 3v3 Asians Parliamentary Debate, and the [[wikipedia:British Parliamentary Style"|British Parliamentary Debate]], which has four teams of two in a single debate.  In addition to foyer debates, it participates in national and international debating competitions all year round. Members choose their own teams or decide to adjudicate. Participating at many high-quality tournaments is regarded as the way to excel, and members are supported by the society for things like getting permissions from professors, and reimbursement of expenses.  Other events conducted include the Intra-KGP Debate Tournament and the [[Foundation Day]] debates.  ==History== [[File:DebSoc Foundation Day workshop 2013.jpg"|thumb"|Debating Society member Sanat Mehrotra conducting the freshers' workshop on 18 August 2013.]] ===KGP Debate Club=== Although students have been arguing at IIT Kharagpur for over half a century, the activity was only institutionalized in 2009 as a part of the 'KGP Debate Club'. It was founded by Sumeet Mohanty (BT '11) and started as a loose affiliate of the [[Technology Literary Society]] (TLS). The KGP Debate Club began its activities on campus as an active interest group and marked IIT Kharagpur's entry into competitive parliamentary debating. Membership was not exclusive - meetings and debates were open to all and were held in the institute foyer. There were only a handful of members in the Autumn of 2009 and almost all the early recruits were from TLS. The NLSPD 2009 in Bangalore was the first tournament at which the KGP Debate Club represented IIT Kharagpur. This was followed by participation at NUJSPD 2010 by a team of freshers. The Debate Club held its first open selections prior to this tournament, and all the participants for the tournament were selected here. <ref name="verified_whiplash" />  ===Incorporation as a Gymkhana society=== In Autumn, 2010, the KGP Debate Club was formalized as a full-fledged Gymkhana society independent of the TLS. The first governors were Achyut Bihani (BT '12), Shikha Singh (MA '13) and Anand Kr (CS '12).  Early in the Autumn of 2011, the number of governors was increased to four, and the KGP Debate Club was rechristened as 'Debating Society, IIT Kharagpur'. Two of the Governors - Adarsh Mathew and Prashanth Durai - commissioned a logo for the society, and it was created by Avik Dey. In the same semester, the Debating Society and [[Spring Fest]] agreed to jointly conduct IIT Kharagpur's first-ever Model United Nations Conference. Thus, IIT Kharagpur Model United Nations Conference was founded with Prashanth Durai as the first [[wikipedia:Secretary_(title)#Secretary-General"|Secretary-General]]. <ref name="verified_whiplash" />

Music Society''', popularly known as '''ETMS''', is one of the two official music societies in IIT Kharagpur, which takes care of the eastern music culture in the campus. The society aims at spreading diverse musical sections of eastern music in both hindustani and carnatic styles, nurturing and motivating musicians, inculcating values and expression through music, and develop good music taste among our audience.   ==Functioning== ===Selection Procedure=== ETMS selection auditions are held twice in a year, in the autumn semester for all students (UG/PG), around the month of July/August and January. Selection procedure generally consist of two rounds, where the first round is a preliminary screening round to assess basic musical ability, comfort with the instrument (or singing), basic knowledge, and screened candidates are invited to give a second round of auditions where they are given few (2-3) songs to prepare. For instrumentalists, the songs that are decided are generally same for everyone, and they are chosen such that they cover a diverse spectrum of techniques/skills in the particular instrument, and for vocalists, the songs are given on the basis of the pitch range and the singer's tonality. There is generally a gap of 3-4 days between both rounds of the auditions.  ===Organizational Structure=== ETMS has three governors selected by the society seniors every year who govern the society and represent it in Gymkhana. Overall co-ordination during practices, productions and competitions are handled by the governors.  ==Activities== The primary activities of the society include organizing and performing two productions every academic year, one in the Autumn Semester and the other in Spring Semester. The playlist is decided few weeks prior to the production through a consensus of all the members in the society. Songs are chosen so that the playlist is as diverse as possible, consisting of genres such as Classical, Classical Fusion, Fusion with western genres and songs from Bollywood. ===Autumn Production=== ETMS performs the Annual Foundation Day of the Institute in the autumn semester on 18th August. This is also the first time the new inductees get the chance to perform for the society.  ===Spring Production=== ETMS performs the spring production in the spring semester generally in the month of January, the starting day of Spring Fest. This production also gives the platform to showcase our talent to viewers from outside as well. This happens to be the final production of the graduating batch and they get a chance to play some of their favourite songs for one last time in KGP.  ==Governors==  {"| class="wikitable" "|- ! colspan="5" "|List of Governors "|- "|'''2019-20'''"|"|Paritosh Jawalikar"|"|Raj Narayanan"|"|- "|- "|'''2018-19'''"|"|Manan Makhija"|"|Mohit Verma"|"|Nishok Sundarresan "|- "|'''2017-18'''"|"|Ashandeep Singh Sekhon"|"|Mohnish Singh Jaswal"|"|Sreekar Saripalli "|- "|'''2016-17'''"|"|Abhishek Bhowmick"|"|Vinay Bhaskar"|"|Yash Deo "|- "|'''2015-16''' "|Gaurav Kumar Jha "|Nayan Mallick "|Sanat Panda "|- "|'''2014-15''' "|Chandrani Haldar "|Rohit Narurkar "|Satyajit Sai "|- "|'''2013-14''' "|Apoorv Raj "|Siddharth Vashishtha "|Sricharan Sunder "|- "|'''2012-13''' "|Anurag Bishnoi "|Gaurav Gupta "|Kaushik Sivaramakrishnan "|- "|'''2011-12''' "|Ankit D.P.

The society selects a batch of 30-40 first years (UG) and 5-10 (PG) at the beginning of the academic year soon after the welcome production. Selection procedure consists of tasks that judge voice modulation, intensity, speech and diction, confidence and acting skills.    In rare cases, exceptional and highly enthusiastic people are also inducted into ENCORE who share a similar passion of theater and contribute to the society. Past members who were inducted include Kaustabh Khare.   [[File:Encore Governors 2015-16.jpg"|thumb"|The Governors for the year 2015-16]]  ===Organizational Structure===  ENCORE has four governors selected by the society seniors every year who govern the society and represent it in the Gymkhana.

The cast ranges from second years to fifth years. Over the years it has been observed that ENCORE generally picks up comical plays and sketch comedy to entertain the freshers. This is also the first time the Governors for the new tenure are introduced to KGP.  [[File:Encore improv welcome.jpg"|thumb"|An Impromptu act by Mudit Rustagi and Kartikeya Pradhan for the Welcome Production by Encore in 2013.]] [[File:Encore invisible man welcome.jpg"|thumb"|Monoacting the invisible man by Mayank Das.]]  ===Freshers' Workshop=== The freshers are given a thorough training of theatre oriented workshops that teaches them the basics of dramatics. Skills like voice modulation, voice intensity, dramatization, body posture, stage movements, third forms, etc are taught in groups. First years along with the four governors train for three weeks at the Vikramshila Foyer (commonly referred to as Baap Ki Jagah by the ENCORE fraternity). Occasional skits, monologues, and challenging impromptu are attempted to improve the versatility of the actor. For tenures in which a PG Batch is also inducted, separate workshops are conducted for them.  ===Freshers' Production=== [[File:Encore AAFT freshers.JPG"|thumb"|The freshers' production in 2015-16.]] The Governors with the help of the entire society train the first years and with rigorous practice put up a production, with the entire cast being first years. For tenures in which a PG Batch was also inducted, a separate production is done by them.  ===Nukkad Natak=== Nukkad Natak is the only event during the entire year when ENCORE does a play/street play in Hindi. Only the second years take part in the Nukkad Natak competition organized during SpringFest.  ===Rangmanch=== [[File:Encore benare abhivyakti.jpg"|thumb"|The final monologue by Leela Benare played by Abhivyakti Dixit.]] ENCORE also participates annually in the Stage Play event of SpringFest i.e. Rangmanch. ===Annuals=== The last act of the year (referred to as the Annual Production) is performed during End-March to Early-April.

First held in 2005, by the then TIETS-Student Chapter, with just one [[wikipedia:In-house"|in-house]] competition, viz. Concipio, it grew on to become a full-fledged Entrepreneurship Summit in 2007 to the Global Entrepreneurship Summit in 2010, attracting participation from different countries like Singapore, Germany, the United States of America and Japan.

It is a get-together of motivated students, aspiring entrepreneurs as well as established professionals, who meet under various formal and informal sessions, which include Guest Lectures, Workshops, Conferences such as Venture Capitalist Conference, Global Entrepreneurship Conference, etc.  ==== Global Entrepreneurship Conference ==== With the advent of new technologies and the [[wikipedia:World_wide_web"|world wide web]], the world has become a small place to live in, and boundaries are political than physical. Hence, development taking place in one country of the world seldom fails to have an effect in another. With this in mind, E-Cell hosts the Global Entrepreneurship Conference (GEC), in which organizations from across the Globe participate and, through [[wikipedia:Video_Conferencing"|Video Conferencing]] discuss the entrepreneurial ecosystem prevailing in their respective countries and try to gather the best of that taking place in different countries. This conference is represented by a panel from each of the organizations, and is screened to the audience at IIT Kharagpur.

These workshops focus on a wide variety of topics and aim at building a broader understanding of new forms of innovation and analysing the key challenges posed to entrepreneurs. They typically address some of the critical issues faced by entrepreneurs like Business-plan writing and funding one’s own venture. Other technical and non-technical areas like [[wikipedia:Risk_Management"|Risk Management]], [[wikipedia:Financial_Analysis"|Financial Analysis]], opportunities of innovation and entrepreneurship available in certain sectors, are also taken up. These workshops are conducted annually by organizations like [[wikipedia:Intel"|Intel]], [[wikipedia:Novell"|Novell]], [[wikipedia:Confederation_of_Indian_Industry"|CII]]-Sorabhji [[wikipedia:Godrej_Infotech_Ltd"|Godrej]], Seeders, [[wikipedia:Wipro"|Wipro]] (WiCamp) etc.  === Knowledge Camp === ''Knowledge Camp'' is held annually within the Institute and aims at encouraging  students to interact among themselves regarding new emergent technologies and business issues like alternate energy, finance, carbon trading etc. The topics chosen are from those in which there is active research with applications in industry and at the same time general enough to invoke interest.  A typical Knowledge Camp session would begin with the introduction of the topic, declared well in advance, followed by presentations by speakers. Every member is by default invited to make presentations, with the liberty of content and duration. While the delivery is on, the topic is open to the house for questions and to add to any of the subtopics covered. Although they need not be after rigorous research or core calculations, such content is more than welcome. A reliable source is acceptable for discussions as well as presentations. It provides a learning platform for students from all disciplines and areas irrespective of their year of study. Presenters include students and research scholars presently working in the fields.  === Fund-a-''KGP''ian === Alumni of IIT Kharagpur are a very important source of funds for development projects within the Institute. Taking this into account, E-Cell has a unique programme by which it recommends to the alumni network, certain good ideas that students of the institute have come up with. These entries are then scrutinized by the respective alumni, who then help finance or mentor these ideas, as they develop into a full-grown company.  === Innovation Platform === Innovation Platform (IP) is a platform provided by E-Cell for those students interested in starting-up. Entrepreneurial ideas are invited from the First Year students of the Institute, and the best among these, selected by professors, are then provided with funding by TIETS and mentoring by the professors. This takes place alongside the regular academic course, so that when the students leave the Institute at the end of their fourth- or fifth- year, as the case may be, their idea grows into a company that can face the stiff competition in the real world. Some of these ideas, related to product designing have been awarded the coveted ''Kishore Vaigyanik Protsahan Yojana'' ([[wikipedia:KVPY"|KVPY]]) scholarship, offered by the Government of India.  == Achievements ==  === Rajendra Mishra School of Engineering Entrepreneurship === The [[wikipedia:Rajendra_Mishra_School_of_Engineering_Entrepreneurship"|Rajendra Mishra School of Engineering Entrepreneurship]], IIT Kharagpur was started in the year 2010, largely due to the efforts of E-Cell. This is the first school in India, which imparts entrepreneurial education at college level. Students of IIT Kharagpur have the option to take up the M.S. course offered by SoEE, alongside their regular B.Tech course, and upon successful completion of the both the courses, are awarded a Dual Degree (B.Tech.+M.S.).  Under this course, students have subjects which, unlike MBA courses that deal with corporate management, help them in the specific task of management within a startup, which is quite different from the former. In the fifth-year, students are provided with funding up to Rs. 1 Lakh and also mentoring and incubation to enable them to develop their own company.  === Deferred Placement Programme === Deferred Placement Programme (DPP) acts as a cushion to those who want to pursue with their entrepreneurial idea after completion of their study in the Institute. Under this programme, if the student does not wish to take up a campus placement offer, he/she can pursue with their startup, and if, after a period of one year, they wish again to take up a job, may attend the campus-interviews in the year subsequent to that of their passing out. <nowiki> </nowiki>IIT-Kharagpur is the first institute to offer this programme at Undergraduate-level.  === Kairos Society === The [[wikipedia:Kairos_Society"|Kairos Society]], a US-based not-for-profit student-run organization<ref>http://www.kairossociety.com/about/about-kairos-society/</ref> organizes an annual Summit on Entrepreneurship.

It organises the annual Space Technology and Astronomy themed fest, [[National Students' Space Challenge]]<ref>[http://nssc.in/ NSSC]</ref> (NSSC) every year since 2011. '''spAts''' ignites a passion for space exploration at IIT Kharagpur by organizing talks, discussions, stargazing sessions, lectures, and presentations.   The group publishes a bi- semester newsletter, ''''The Moonwalk'''<nowiki/>', which features on latest ventures in space technology and astronomy related articles and developments.<ref name="The Statesman"></ref>  ==History== The Space Technology Students' Society was founded way back in 2008 by a group of students extremely enthusiastic about the frontiers of space technology. It was formed as an official student body under the Kalpana Chawla Space Technology Cell (KCSTC). Since then, the society has grown in size and activities. The idea of a national level space-oriented fest was conceived and thus implemented as the National Students' Space Challenge (NSSC) in the year 2011. NSSC has been successfully organised for twelve more editions since then.  A subgroup of spAts, the FQTQ team which is a dedicated Astronomy discussion group was formed in 2016 under the guidance of Siddhant Singh.   ==Functioning== The student body of spAts is divided into two subgroups - the core teams consisting of Design team, Tech team and Management team (which is more concerned with management and outreach) and the FQTQ team (which is more based on Astronomical discussions and applications). spAts organises sky-gazing sessions, space-themed discussions and talks, webinars, lectures, presentations and publishes the bi-semester newsletter, "the moonwalk" for the people in the IIT Kharagpur community. The teams also organise the National Students' Space Challenge during the months of September-October.  ===Selection Procedure=== spAts organises its selections during late August, once per year that is aimed only for the newly joining freshers for a continued membership till the end of the members' tenure. spAts organises an introductory seminar before the selections, where the functioning of the society as well as about NSSC is presented.   The interested candidates join as Junior Coordinators (JCoords) who conduct the NSSC. For the JCoord team, the candidate's technological, management, communication skills etc. are considered.   Later, selections for joining the spAts team happen, where interested candidates select one portfolio from the FQTQ team, Design team, Tech team and Management team where emphasis is given on prior knowledge in the specific portfolio, presentation skills, previous experience with the concerned technologies and knowledge in the fields of Astronomy and Astrophysics. Selections are done in three rounds, an initial interview, a task round and a final interview where the task submissions are reviewed.   ===Organisational Structure=== spAts is mainly comprised of its two subgroups - the Core teams and the FQTQ team. Each subgroup have their own undertaking tasks but mainly the whole team collectively organises the NSSC fest.   ====Core teams==== These teams are mainly responsible for Management, Outreach, Communication, Publicity, Sponsor handling, Design, Web Design and Finance for the fest and the other activities spAts organises. The core teams consist of the Design team, the Tech team and the Management team  ====FQTQ team==== FQTQ stands for From Quarks to Quasars, which describes the team more oriented to astrophysics in general. They hold periodic discussions and presentations on various topics along with sky-gazing events, open talks, webinars and content development.  ====NSSC==== Conducting the fest remains a major task for the whole spAts team. The team structure is as follows -   *5th and the 4th years comprise the Steering Committee (SCom) *3rd Years are the Heads *2nd Years function as Sub-Heads for the various events *First Years contribute as Junior Coordinators (JCoords) for the fest  ==List of Activities== spAts organizes a lot of activities within the campus, as mentioned below.  ===Induction Workshop=== The spAts team interacts with the new coming Freshers batch during the Induction Programme through a series of presentations and workshops. In 2018, presentation on the life cycle of stars, the ever endless universe; and hand-on experience through water rocket lift-off workshop was conducted. The workshop received a positive response from the participants.  ===National Students' Space Challenge=== The '''National Students' Space Challenge''', abbreviated as '''NSSC''', is an annual space-themed fest organised in the month of September-October since the year 2011. It is India's first and the largest space technology and Astronomy themed fest. The whole spAts team is indulged in organizing the fest.  For more details find it on - [https://nssc.in NSSC]  ===Sky-Gazing Sessions=== spAts also works to popularize astronomy among the people in the KGP community. Hence it organizes sky-gazing sessions every semester and also to cover exciting astronomical events, like the super blood red moon 30th January, 2017.   ===Space Month=== Every Year spAts observes the month of March as Space Month, where a series of open discussions, webinars quiz or presentations are held. This space month primarily aimed to bring and contribute towards recent developments in space technology.  ===The Moonwalk=== The Moonwalk is a bi-semester newsletter brought by the spAts team. It includes articles written on several astrophysical ideas, new perspectives arising in space and planetary sciences, recent developments in the field, contributions by eminent scientists over the world and discoveries.  ==Awards and Achievements== {"| class="wikitable" !Competition !Venue !About !Year !Position "|- "|Astro Quiz, Supernova, TechNex "|IIT (BHU) Varanasi "|Team name - "TheKGPCrux" "|2019 "|GOLD "|- "|Exploring the Interstellar, Supernova, TechNex "|IIT (BHU) Varanasi "|Observational astronomy based event "|2019 "|SILVER "|- "|Scientists of Utopia, Supernova, TechNex "|IIT (BHU) Varanasi "|Case study event "|2019 "|SILVER "|- "|Scientists of Utopia, Supernova, TechNex "|IIT (BHU) Varanasi (Online) "|Case study event "|2021 "|GOLD "|- "|Astro Quiz, Supernova, TechNex "|IIT (BHU) Varanasi (Online) "|Space Quiz Event "|2021 "|GOLD "|- "|International Astronomy and Astrophysics Competition "|Online "|Eeshaan Sethia (Subhead) - International Runner Up "|2022 "|National Topper "|}  ==References== <references />  [[Category:Societies and clubs]]     The''' [https://student-welfare-group.com/ Student Welfare Group]''' (SWG) is a student body under the office of the Dean of Students’ Affairs, IIT Kharagpur'''.'''  It strives to be with those who need help and promises to sweat for the realization and solutions of issues faced by our fellow mates. It is an organization of the students, for the students, by the students. It functions as two teams:  *The Central Team *The Hall Coordinators Team  ==History== The Counselling Centre was set up in 2009 by the Dean Of Students′ Affairs, IIT Kharagpur as an outcome of his efforts to make the campus a better campus for the entire student community.  It provided the students a place where they could easily approach with a problem and leave with a solution. The reach of the Counselling Centre was further extended through the Hall Coordinators Team. However, the increasing strength of students in the campus called for active participation from the students themselves in this cause. This was the scenario which saw the establishment of the Student Welfare Group in August 2011.  Student Welfare Group was initially an idea that evolved out of a feeling to perpetuate and nurture a campus life which is hassle-free. Today, it is a dedicated group of students willing to sort out various issues of concern for the students. It plans to emerge as a more successful organization with more activities managed and implemented for the welfare of students.  ==Vision==  The aim of SWG is to ensure that every student's life in KGP is hassle free so that they can achieve their potential zenith while their stay in KGP as well as in their professional career. SWG aims to instil a belief in every student that they can achieve all their goals in life. SWG assists students in resolving their difficulties in every field, be it academic or extra-academic & curricular or co-curricular. It aims to create and sustain an environment that promotes personal growth and discovery, the pursuit of healthy minds and bodies, and participation in the creation of a caring community.  ==Events and programmes==  ===Student Mentorship Programme=== This programme involves the guidance and mentorship of every single first year student by a 3rd or 4th year student of the same department. The objective of this programme is to help the first years understand the various aspects of college life, and adapt accordingly. This programme ensures that the hindsight of the Mentor becomes the foresight of the Mentee. The Mentees can benefit immensely from the insight of the Mentor and find the best possible way to utilize their time in the campus. The Student Mentor Programme provides scope for constructive and productive interaction between the freshmen and the experienced seniors, which forms an integral part of college life.  ===PDS Doubt Sessions=== An interactive session organized by the SWG for those who feel like they are lagging behind in the course because of no prior knowledge. [[Programming and Data Structures]] is an important course of the first year curricula. The instructors are senior students of the institute who try to increase the problem tackling capability of the students, starting from the very basic level and build up their confidence to face the competition. In Friday’s sessions, tutorial sheets are provided to the students and the tutors help them to solve the questions by clearing the doubts of each and every student. In Sunday’s sessions, students are supposed to come with their laptops and they are given a set of programming questions like the ones given in PDS Laboratory classes. The tutors help the students in coding, compiling and running their programs. At the end of the sessions, the instructors also provide printed solution of the tutorial sheet to the students.  ===GD/PI Sessions=== Student Welfare Group in association with Smart Training Institute, a renowned organization for grooming and perfecting '''soft skills''', presents an opportunity to boost students' performance at group discussions and personal interviews just as the season for internships and placements begins. The workshop has been a success in the past with most of the students giving positive feedback. Since the collaboration with the private institute is in its early phase, there is a lot of room and scope in future. Taking into consideration the feedback, the SWG aims to provide better workshops in the following sessions.  ===Panel Discussion (Wings Of Fire)=== Student Welfare Group organised a Panel Discussion by the batch of 2010-11. It invited students to open up to the valuable experience shared by the panelists in a discussion encompassing every facet of KGP life, including academics, extracurriculars, sports, societies and PORs. This discussion was very helpful for freshers who had just joined the institute. Panelists shared their vast experience of 4-5 years in KGP. Apart from freshers, a large number of 2nd and 3rd year students also gathered for this panel discussion.    ===ForeSight=== '''SWG''' presents '''ForeSight''', a program which provides the campus students a unique interface to connect with the people who have mastered their field and hence get a foresight of their future. It will cover various career related dimensions (placements, internships, FTs, competitions) from the students of the campus as well as alumni of the institute.  ===The Campus Tour=== A campus ride is being organized to acquaint freshers about the important places of the campus that a student needs to know. It begins from Technology Students' Gymkhana, IIT Kharagpur (TSG). In 2015, more than 1200 freshers in 28 separate buses were shown the magnificence of the KGP campus with engaging interactions of SWG team with freshers.  ===Information Brochure- A Walk Through=== For the first time in the history of our campus, printed version of Institute Information Brochure was circulated among all the freshers, thanks to the rigorous efforts of the SWG team and support of the administration. We hope it has helped the freshers batch a lot in their initial days here at KGP.  [[ISSUE]] <ref>http://issuu.com/studentwelfaregroup/docs/ug_information_brochure</ref>  ===Electrical/Mechanics Doubt Sessions=== Student Welfare Group is proud to announce Electrical and Mechanics Doubt Sessions for the first year UG students with the help of the Vice President, TSG and the faculty of Electrical Technology and Mechanics. The schedule of the doubt sessions is as follows:  '''Every Saturday''' starting from 29th August, 2015.  ===Hall Coordinators Programme=== Student Welfare Group conducts the Hall Coordinators Programme with the help of Hall Coordinators' Team that would work directly with the Counselling Centre for the overall well-being of the fellow peers and thus ensure 'A Hassle-free Kgp Life' !  ===KGP Blood Connect=== Kharagpur Blood Connect, an initiative of Student Welfare Group (SWG) IIT Kharagpur and Gopali Youth Welfare Society, established to serve the same purpose, is always there to help you in making your contribution, as "To the young and healthy it’s no loss. To sick it’s hope of life. Donate Blood to give back life." It is an endeavour of ensuring that no one on campus struggles to find a blood donor in times of need!  ===Public Speaking Forum=== SWG has come with Public Speaking Forum , a platform which'll make you aptly equipped to fight the fear of Public Speaking. This is an 8 session long program. The initiative mainly concentrates on the individuals with a basic knowledge of English language however speaking on a public platform bothers them which can prove to be a hindrance in realizing their future endeavors.  ==Governors and Heads==  === 2024 - 25 ===  *'''Advisors''' **Anish Behuray **Jainish Solanki **Khushi Agrawal **Priyanshi Khetan **Shubham Singh **Yash Kumar **JSR Sujit **Nikhitha Sapharu  *'''Executive Heads''' **Shashank Tiwari **Astha Kumari   *'''Heads''' **Akshat Kapoor **Shravan Barad **Bhawesh Kukreja **Vumika Ghosh **Shivam Bisen **Astitva Srivastava   === 2023 - 24 ===  *'''Advisors''' **Rithick Prabakar **Dhruv Rathi **Bishal Kumar Behera **Aditi Ujjain **Lalam Hari Prasad **Md Zaid Alam **Pratik Choudhury **Sneha Majumder **Keval Mehta **Himadri Pandya **Abhishek  *'''Executive Heads''' **JSR Sujit **Nikhitha Sapharu  *'''Heads''' **Anish Behuray **Jainish Solanki **Khushi Agrawal **Priyanshi Khetan **Shubham Singh **Yash Kumar  ===2022-23===  *'''Advisors''' **Devesh Gobind **Tanaya Ramane **Swagat Kumar Panda **Sreeya Chillapuri **Waqaar Hussain **Awais Akhtar **Sri Harika Reddy **Yathartha Soneji **Vedant Vani **Jeripothula Sindhu **Bhosale Shivam Pravin  *'''Executive Heads''' **Himadri Pandya **Abhishek  *'''Heads''' **Rithick Prabakar **Dhruv Rathi **Bishal Kumar Behera **Aditi Ujjain **Lalam Hari Prasad **Keval Mehta **Md Zaid Alam **Pratik Choudhury **Sneha Majumder  ===2021-22===  *'''Advisors''' **Kunal Das **Lavish Singhal **Tapasya Pratap Singh **Devang Upadhyaya **Aditi Singhania **Nikhil Kumar **Animesh Jha **Prachi Kharparde **Akash Dusane  *'''Executive Heads''' **Jeripothula Sindhu **Bhosale Shivam Pravin  *'''Heads''' **Devesh Gobind **Tanaya Ramane **Swagat Kumar Panda **Sreeya Chillapuri **Waqaar Hussain **Awais Akhtar **Sri Harika Reddy **Yathartha Soneji **Vedant Vani   ==Governors and Heads== ===2019-20===  *'''Governors''' **Akshat Jain **Anju Joon **Lakshya Agrawal **Nishchal Baghele  *'''Advisors''' **Rajat Goel  *'''Heads''' **Anshul Agarwal **Kunal Das **Lavish Singhal **Mrityunjay Mehta **Ritam Talukder **Shivam Bhatia **Tapasya Pratap Singh  ===2018-19===  *'''Governors''' **Utkarsh Kumar **Pushpendra Singh Rathore **Priyang Mani Tripathi **Aamol Lohani  *'''Advisors''' **Dileep Shukla **TYSS Santosh **Saurabh Chandra Pandey  *'''Heads''' **Rajat Goel **Prateek Manikpuri **Akshat Jain **Anju Joon **Lakshya Agrawal **Nishchal Baghele **Rajdeep Singh **Yograj Sirohi  ===2017-18===  *'''Governors''' **Nihal Gupta **Vaibhav Agrawal **Raju Bhakar  *'''Advisors''' **Shashwat Mishra **Prasanna Dange  *'''Heads''' **Utkarsh Kumar **Pushpendra Singh Rathore **Aamol Lohani **Dileep Shukla **Priyang Mani Tripathi **TYSS Santosh **Saurabh Chandra Pandey  ===2016-17===  *'''Governors''' **Amey Muley **Akash Khandelwal **Karan Gupta  *'''Advisors''' **Tushar Gupta **Ashutosh Yadav **Manoj Meena **Siddhant Jain **Sanket Modi  *'''Heads''' **Raju Bhakar **Prasanna Dange **Ankur Ankit **Surendra Puri **Shashwat Mishra **Nihal Gupta **Vaibhav Agrawal **Zain Ahmad **Veda Vyshnavi **Pranitha Sriramoju  ===2015-16===  *'''Governors''' **Akash Verma **Amit Anand **Nikhil Kedia **Sourav Basu  *'''Advisors''' **Sheenal Chhabra **Abhishek Chakraborty **Nishant Agarwal **Shankar Basava **Uma Ravali **Ankit Bansal **Shyam Simaria  *'''Heads''' **Manoj Meena **Prithvi Krishna **Kunwarvir Singh **Akash Khandelwal **Chahak Tharani **Ravina Moirangthem **Ashutosh Yadav **Tushar Gupta **Karan Gupta **Ishan Jain **Siddhant Jain **Sanket Modi **Amey Muley  ==='''2014-15'''===  *'''Governors''' **Abhishek Chaudhary **Nishchay Dayal  *'''Heads''' **Akash Verma **Amit Anand **Nikhil Kedia **Sourav Basu **Sheenal Chhabra **Abhishek Chakraborty **Nishant Agarwal **Shankar Basava **Uma Ravali **Ankit Bansal **Shyam Simaria  ==References== <references />  ==External Links==  =====[https://swgiitkgp.org/ https://student-welfare-group.com/]=====  =====https://www.facebook.com/SWGIITKGP<nowiki/>===== '''https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.swg.swg_app&hl=en_IN&gl=US&pli=1'''  '''https://medium.com/@swgiitkgp'''  '''https://www.instagram.com/swg.iit_kgp/''' [[Category:Societies and clubs]]  ==Introduction== TAdS is bringing 'true' extreme sports to your door step.

The team designs, manufactures and tests Formula style prototype, single-seat race cars. It represents IIT Kharagpur at national and international Formula Student competitions, [https://www.imeche.org/events/formula-student Formula Student, UK] and [https://www.formulabharat.com/ Formula Bharat].   ==About us== The purpose of the group is to develop formula student race cars. Formula Student is widely regarded as one of the biggest and most challenging student-level engineering competitions in the world. It intends to give students a great learning experience across all domains of engineering industry: design, manufacturing, project management, financial management and business planning.  The journey of each new car begins with its design. This involves application of all the classroom knowledge in actual engineering problems to achieve the set goals for the car and its different systems, through modelling, simulation and experimentation. The next challenge is to bring this design to reality, by checking the feasibility of various designs, fabricating different parts of the car through various manufacturing processes, and assembling them to the final stage. The last phase involves testing and tuning the systems of the car to rectify problems and achieve set targets.  Supporting the car though this journey are the aspects of project management, cost planning,sponsorship and public relations. Effective project management is important to ensure that the entire production of the car, from designing, to manufacturng, to testing gets completed on time, and with positive outputs. Careful financial planning and management is required to ensure the best utilization of team's resources. Sponsorships are acquired from various industry partners to develop the team's resouce pool. Good public relations have to be maintained with various industry partners of the team, as well as with the team's supporters though meetings, social media and public events.  As a part of one of the events in the competition, the team also develops a complete business plan to launch the car as a product in the market. This involves performing an in-depth case study and presenting a plan on the business strategy, finance, production and marketing of a race car start-up company.  The activities of the group provide an all-round experience for its members to build a great skill set for themselves, and be a part of a team representing the institute at an international level.  ==History==  Its foundation was laid in 2008. It was an outcome of efforts of a few enthusiastic founding members and faculty advisers. The team took a solid form with the support of Prof. PP Chakraborty (Former Director, IIT Kharagpur) and Prof. Sunando Dasgupta (present Dean SRIC, IIT Kharagpur). [https://siddkhastgir.com/ Sidhartha Khastgir] became the first Team Leader and stirred the team through the difficult initial stages where the team faced shortage of funds and technical knowledge.  Since then it has grown to become IIT Kharagpur’s largest student project encompassing around 70 students from 10 different departments. Ganesh Kumar M. became the second team leader and held responsibility for three years and oversaw the development of K-1 and K-2. Till date the team has successfully made five cars- the KX-1, the K-1, K-2, K-3 & K-4. K-2 competed at Formula Student UK 2013. Several design oversights in K2 were fixed in K-2.2 by a new chassis and intake-exhaust system; which competed at Formula Design Challenge 2015 (FSI 15).   ==Formula Student==  [[wikipedia:Formula_Student"|Formula Student]]  is Europe's most established educational motorsport competition, run by the [[wikipedia:Institution_of_Mechanical_Engineers"|Institution of Mechanical Engineers]](IMechE). Universities from across the globe are challenged to design and build a single-seat racing car in order to compete in static and dynamic events, which demonstrate their understanding and test the performance of the vehicle. The format of the event  is such that it provides an ideal opportunity for the students to demonstrate and improve their capabilities to deliver a complex and integrated product in the demanding environment of a  motorsport competition.  ==Formula Bharat== [https://www.formulabharat.com/ Formula Bharat] is an engineering design competition in which students from colleges and universities all over India, compete with a life-size Formula-style vehicle in areas of engineering design, overall cost, marketability and dynamic performance. Being identical to the global student hosted in around eleven countries per year, the event encourages students to gain hands-on practical experience, while applying engineering theories studied in the classroom. It is hosted and managed by Mobility Engineering Consortium Pvt. Ltd., an organization dedicated towards hosting mobility-related competitions for students.  ==Cars==  ===KX-1=== The KX-1 was the team's first effort to build a car. The X' in the name stands for experiment as the car was the very first attempt of the completely novice team.

An innovative FS car should be sleek, light-weight, fast and efficient. Our latest car K4 checks off all those boxes, considering that it is one of the lightest and fastest cars we have manufactured since inception. It also boasts of several new upgrades that have added a sense of accomplishment to our car.  Powertrain  K4 has a 3D printed (chemically welded) side intake which helped us to reduce the overall weight of the car. For the first time, K4 underwent dyno-tuning at a facility in Bengaluru which resulted in better power output and greater fuel efficiency. Eccentric differential mounts were installed which helped in chain tensioning and further reduced the weight.  Chassis  The acceleration and performance of the car improved as we successfully reduced the chassis weight by 10 kg as compared to our previous car K3. This was achieved with the proper usage of AISI 4130 mild steel over the AISI 1080 version. Moreover, extensive work into triangulation enabled us to design a smart and efficient structure.  Aerodynamics  K4 has been made by implementing our Team’s first aerodynamic package element, the under-body diffuser. {"| class="wikitable" "|General "| *Overall Length: 2830mm *Curb weight: 251.5kgf *Tyre Specifications: 20.5 x 7.0 - 13 R25B Hoosier *Wheel Rim Diameter: 13" "|- "|Chassis "| *Material: Tubular Seamless Carbon Steel *Frame Weight: 35kgf *Front Track: 130.0 cm *Rear Track: 130.0 cm "|- "|Engine "| *Engine Displacement: 373.2cc *Engine Choice: KTM 390 DUKE,Single cylinder *Engine Intake: Plenum made by rapid prot *Maximum Torque: 33Nm @ 5500rpm *Maximum Bhp : 33BHP @ 7000rpm *Fuel: RON 95 "|- "|Steering & Suspension "| *Suspension Type: SLA Double Wishbone *Wheelbase: 1580mm *Steering: Rack & Pinion type "|- "|Brakes "| *Brake Type: Disc Brake *Brake Details: Multi-Piston with brake biasing *Caliper: Fixed Caliper Type "|- "|Transmission "| *Clutch type Limited Slip Differential (Drexler). *Chain and sprocket based final drive system designed "|} <br />  ==Team Structure== Team KART comprises undergraduate students from 1st to the 5th years.

The society used to publish the monthly wall magazine [[Hang On (magazine)"|Hang On]], and the literary newsletter [[KGP Pulse (newsletter)"|KGP Pulse]] but they have been discontinued in favour of using social media to reach a larger population. TLS continues to publish the annual campus magazine [[Alankar (magazine)"|Alankar]]''.''  ==Campus Events== ===Kavya Sandhya=== In the year 2014-15 a new event was introduced by TLS on the lines of a ''Kavi Sammelan, ''christened '''Kavya Sandhya'''. The first edition was primarily experimental in nature, with the Hindi poets from Team TLS exhibiting their poetry and oratory skills on stage. the event received great admiration from the ''kavi''s in the campus and that motivated us to bring it in a larger scale as the '''Kavyanjali. Kavya Sandhya''' is held till date in the autumn semester and gives a chance for the Hindi poets of the campus to dazzle the audience with their words.  ===Kavyanjali=== Continuing the legacy of Kavya Sandha, during the spring semester of year 2014-15 TLS collaborated with [[Awaaz]] and [[Rajbhasha Vibhag]] to organize ''Kavyanjali'' in the [[Kalidas auditorium]] where acclaimed Hindi poets like Prof. Prem Shankar Tripathi, Shri Ravi Pratap Singh, Shri Jagesh Tiwari presided the event. Since then, '''Kavyanjali''' is held annually in the spring semester where poets from outside and as well as inside the KGP campus enrapture the audience with their lines.  ===Poetry Slam=== In the year 2014-15, for the first time, TLS hosted a Poetry slam event during Spring fest. The event saw participation from 6 colleges and it was open for both Hindi and English poets.  ===Farrago=== In the year 2018-19, for the first time, an English spoken word event called '''Farrago''' was conducted. The event was held to promote the culture of English spoken word. The event saw participation from TLS members as well as some exceptional poets outside TLS from the campus.   ==Online Presence== TLS regularly publishes content from its [https://www.facebook.com/tls.iitkgp <u>Facebook page</u>]. Seeing the growing popularity of the social media platform Instagram, TLS also made its debut on Instagram and started regularly publishing from its [https://www.instagram.com/tls.iitkgp/ <u>Instagram page</u>] since 2019.  ==History==  While the exact year is unknown, Technology Literary Society is believed to be founded sometime in the 50s{{citation needed}}, along with [[Pravah"| Hindi Technology Dramatics Society]] in the same year which makes it one of the first societies in KGP. TLS was previously responsible for conducting KGP's literary fest, called [[Manzar]] and publishing the annual campus magazine, [[Alankar]]. Manzar was conducted in the week following [[Spring Fest]], another one of KGP's long standing traditions. But when [[Kshitij]] was started in 2002, the time slots for Spring Fest and [[Manzar]] were merged, both being in the socio-cultural arena. In those days, SF did not conduct literary events. When the time slots for Manzar and SF were merged, logistical problems arose between SF and TLS teams, both competing for time slots and venues. Then TLS was broken in 2 parts, one responsible for Manzar to be merged with SF, another to be responsible for Alankar  However, TLS kept the its tradition the same, keeping 9 Governors (which made sense while they had to conduct a fest). This was a period of decline for TLS as it had no responsibility other than to publish [[Alankar]] at the end of the year. However, it maintained its 9 Governors.  In the year 2008, TLS came up with a new publication - [[Hang On]], a monthly wall magazine which would be a satirical depiction of events around KGP and the world. Hang On was meant to be mostly humorous in nature while the more serious pieces were kept for ALANKAR. In 2009, TLS founded another bi-monthly publication - [[KGP Pulse]] which would frequent the more "literary" pursuits of its members and students from KGP but these were discontinued in 2016. In 2010, TLS for the first time started conducting events along with Spring Fest, which can be seen till date. In the same year, 2010, Alankar was not published due to Gymkhana budget constraints. It was, however, revived after a gap of 3 years in 2012 and since then has been published every year.   From the year 2010-11, there have been only 4 Governors in TLS every year.  There has also been a longstanding debate over what TLS stands for. While some within the team claim that it is to promote literary activities in the campus, some feel that it stands to promote the literary activities among the members. This has been reflected over the years in the change in leadership as each leadership team has their own version of the motive of TLS and acts accordingly. However, TLS has always stood by it's core principle and it's motto - helping KGP to express themselves!  ==Governors== {"| class="wikitable" "|- ! colspan="6" "|List of Governors "|- "|'''2024-25''' "|Amitesh Kumar (HS '26) "|Shivam (GG '26) "|Vidya Niwas Mishra (EE '27) "|- "|'''2023-24''' "|Amrita Ghosh (ME '26) "|Deovardhan (GG '25) "|Indra Kumar Gupta (AE '25) "|Maithili Bhuyar (EE '26) "|Vaishnavi Nikam (ME '25) "|- "|- "|'''2022-23''' "|Pranay Pandey (PH '25) "|Nishita Singh (BT '25) "|Shreya Gupta (HS '25) "|Tanmay Malatkar (IM '24) "|Mehak Sharma (ME '24) "|- "|'''2021-22''' "|Aditi Sisodia (NA '24) "|Apurav Tambe (NA '24) "|Shalmali Sriram (AR '24) "|Umang Pandey (ME '23) "| "|- "|'''2020-21''' "|Sarvesh Deshpande (ME '23) "|Archi Banerjee (PH '23) "|Kshitij Anand (AE '23) "|Utkarsh Agrawal (MF '22) "| "|- "|'''2019-20''' "|Kushal Patankar (MT '21) "|Pankhuri Saxena (HS '22) "|Pranav Shukla (CE '22) "|Prem Shankar (HS '22) "| "|- "|'''2018-19''' "|Yash Shukla (MI '21) "|Aditya Prakash (IM '21) "|Akshit Lonare (EE '20) "|Sourav Garg (EC '21) "| "|- "|'''2017-18''' "|Shreshth Khare(CH'19) "|Aayush Keshva(PH'20) "|Swapnil Batle(MA'20) "|Ashutosh Bhaskar(GG'20) "| "|- "|'''2016-17''' "|"|Lalit Khemlani (EC '18)"|"|Himanshu Mishra (MA '19)"|"|Nitish Kumar (CE '18)"|"|Pankaj Sutar (HS '19)"|"| "|- "|'''2015-16''' "| "|Yash Shrivastava (CS '17)"|"|Rishabh Upadhyay (CY '18)"|"|Sumit Kumar Pandey (MI '17)"|"|Atchuta Srinivas Duddu (IE '17)"|"| "|- "|'''2014-15''' "| "|Ujjwal Dubey (CH '16)"|"|Hardik Rajpal (PH '17)"|"|Triyansha Vijayvargiya (GG '17)"|"|Shailesh Kumar(GG '17)"|"| "|- "|'''2013-14''' "| "|Pragya Sharma (EE '15)"|"|Nidhi Dwivedi (HS '16)"|"|Sushruta Mishra (ME '15)"|"|Ketan Mundhada (AR '16)"|"| "|- "|'''2012-13''' "| "|Rahul Jai Singh (ME '15)"|"|Priya Singh (CH '14)"|"|Vikas Dubey (IM '15)"|"|Saif Khan (CY '15)"|"| "|}  <ref>https://web.archive.org/web/20150515065840/http://www.gymkhana.iitkgp.ernet.in/societies</ref><ref>https://web.archive.org/web/20131121043239/http://www.gymkhana.iitkgp.ernet.in/societies/tls</ref><ref>https://web.archive.org/web/20120912043025/http://www.gymkhana.iitkgp.ernet.in/societies/tls</ref>  ==Archives== [[Category:Societies and clubs]] <references />    '''Technology Robotix Society''' (abbrv. TRS) is an official society under the [[Technology Students' Gymkhana]], IIT Kharagpur and is a focal point for activities and projects related to [[robotics]] in the campus. With its reach expanding steadily each year, it has also cemented its position as one of the nerve centres of amateur robotics in India.  ==History==  ==Activities== Technology Robotix Society (TRS) conducts many events throughout the year, specifically aimed at undergraduate students, with a general aim of spreading robotics culture in the campus and around.   ===KRAIG Classes=== The Kharagpur Robotics and Artificial Intelligence Group (KRAIG) classes are organized by TRS throughout the autumn semester each year and are open to be attended for all students. The main attendees being first year undergraduate students of the campus. The classes cover the basics of robotics, starting off with drives, mechanisms and then moving on to electronics, integrated circuits and finally to the basics of autonomous robotics.  ===Annual Winter Workshop=== The annual winter workshop is conducted each year after the conclusion of the autumn semester. The workshops are mentored by second year robotics enthusiasts including TRS members and interested students are taught the concepts of either autonomous robotics or computer vision, and through that knowledge, attempt to tackle a relevant problem statement. Students are selected through a common test organized by TRS, based on the results of which problem statements and mentors are assigned to the students, which they try to tackle together in one week of time.   ===KRISS=== Kharagpur Robotics and Intelligent Systems Seminars (abbrv. KRISS) is an initiative to bring together people across departments and different years to discuss and exchange ideas related to more mature and nuanced areas of robotics. The primary motivation is to encourage feedback and potential collaboration between interested individuals and also to foster a general culture of research-oriented discussions.  ===Freshers' challenges=== In addition to the classes, TRS also organizes exclusively-for-freshers competitions like [[Robosoccer]] in which students are taught to build a basic differential drive and Pathfinder workshop in which they are taught to build a line follower without writing a single line of code.  In addition to all this, TRS also conducts workshops for robotics in other colleges in India.  ==Robotics Projects== In the past numerous robotics projects have been initiated by Technology Robotix Society alumni, several of which have received independent funding and now have been converted to independent research groups in the campus. Presently, two research projects are being managed by TRS. They are the Quadrotor project and the Swarm project.  ===Aerial Robotics Kharagpur===  Quadrotor is the unmanned aerial vehicle project taken up by Team Robotix, with the initiation taking place from the academic year 2014-15. The ultimate goal of the project is to participate and win in the I.A.R.C.(International Aerial Robotics Competition), which is a highly prestigious and contested global event with realistic and daunting problem statements.  ===Swarm IIT Kharagpur== Swarm Robotics is a very rare project taken up by Team Robotix and there are very few labs which are dealing with swarm robotics in the country. The ultimate aim of this project is to enable a swarm of robots explore an unknown terrain.  ===Makerspace=== Makerspace is an initiative of Team Robotix for encouraging the students to come up with bright ideas for developing robots that could make a change. It is a community-based open source hardware hacking lab to make prototypes of selected hardware implementations as well as a meeting ground for open software projects. TRS aims to undertake small scale projects under this wing to make an everlasting impact on the IIT Kharagpur robotics scenario. Makerspace Projects that have been completed till date include the 2D PLOTTER(A mini version which can print any graphic having size less than 120 * 240 mm), Automated Inventory Management, Self Learning Crawling Robot and the Inter-IIT TCTD challenge.   Projects that have been undertaken and are in progress :                            *QUADRUPED: The basic aim is to build a quadruped equipped with 4 wheels that moves using wheels on plane surfaces and uses its legs to climb stairs/ uneven surfaces. *ROBOTIC ARM:  To build a 5 degree-of-freedom robotic arm by 3 D printing the basic chassis and using servos, is the primary objective. The arm can then be used for a variety of research purposes.  ==Robotix (fest)== The annual fest Robotix, conducted each year during Kshitij is the focal activity of the society in a year. With a footfall of over 2000 each year, it has turned into the largest single robotics based annual agglomeration in South Asia.  Events during Robotix are conducted under three categories: manual, autonomous and programming/online. In the manual events, the participant handles the robot by using a remote control. The remote system may be wired or unwired. The robot then has to perform the specified task, which is usually something mechanical. In the autonomous events, the robots act independently; participants are not allowed to control them during their run. These robots typically use programmed micro-controllers to make decisions. Some events involve more than one robot, and can be a mix of autonomous and manually controlled robots. In the programming events, the participants are given a problem statement and submit code to solve the problem; the competitors are also allowed to submit their solutions online.  ===Robotix 2019=== Robotix 2019 was held from 18-20 January, 2019.

Founded in 2005, copies of ''The Scholars’ Avenue'' were initially delivered to all the students on campus, with soft copies being mailed to the faculty and several thousand alumni all over the world.   Each of the issues is a juxtaposition of the informational, the technical and the creative. ScholsAve reports campus events and happenings, functions as a public interface between students and the administration, summarizes technical advancements taking shape on campus and not the least, prints the funnies. Its pieces include:  *''Editorials'' : The editors’ take on the successive issues that have affected IIT Kharagpur’s campus. *''Interviews'': Interviews with luminaries such as Nawazuddin Siddiqui, Kris Gopalakrishnan, Prahlad Kakkar, KK, Pandit Hariprasad Chaurasia et al. *''Guest Articles'' : Featured articles from guests. *''Careers Avenue'' : A stab at increasing the horizons of the readers. *''Tech Avenue'' : On-campus technical advancements in the spotlight. *''Bhaat Avenue'': Browse through our biweekly dose of humour.  The team is drawn entirely from the students of the institute and acts as the voice of the student community by reporting on events relevant to campus. TSA is also a non-profit organization independent of the administration of IIT Kharagpur and is supported by sponsorships and donations.  ==Early Days== ''"There have always been dreamers; because in our dreams we see not what is, but what can be. There have always been doers; because through our efforts, we make what-can-be what-is. This is how things become possible. This is how the quality of our life improves. Because we dream. Because we do. - Daewoo Motors"''  The Scholars' Avenue (TSA or ScholsAve) was borne out of one such dream. A dream to give IIT Kharagpur its own newspaper that would act as litmus for the mood on campus and provide a medium that students could capitalise to voice their views. It started off in 2005 with an aim to reach every single room on campus via print issues and soon forayed into online media with the establishment of it's website.   Quite a number of issues in, The Scholars' Avenue raised the issue of the condition of the B. C. Roy hospital and reported about a strike within campus. Amidst misunderstandings, major decisions were made which included a ban on the Scholars' Avenue and curtailment of its website. The ban lasted less than a month and TSA decided to no longer stay under the Gymkhana – a move that made it free to decide its content but also left it financially crippled.  ==The Website== The Scholars' Avenue also has a large readership on their website where news is not the only thing that gets published. They also do a number of articles on different genres as listed below. ===Interviews=== A number of interviews are conducted whenever any major personality is in Campus, during elections, and various other situations that would be of potential interest to the KGP populace.   "|"|[https://web.scholarsavenue.org/tagged/interview Link to the Interview Section]"|"|  ===GuestAve=== GuestAve is an open section where anyone, from a fresher to The Student Senate can publish their articles from, after approaching the team.
