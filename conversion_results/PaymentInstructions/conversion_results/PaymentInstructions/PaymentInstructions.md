g. NEFT/RTGS: This mode of payment can be used by students for paying fees from any bank other than SBI. A NEFT challan (sample Challan as given below) will be provided which the student has to give it to the Bank Branch other than SBI from where the student wants to pay the fees. The bank has to remit the amount by NEFT/RTGS as per beneficiary (IIT Kharagpur) account no and IFSC code as mentioned in this challan. SBI will validate the account no and amount. If found ok, the amount will be credited to the designated account of IIT KGP and a online response will be posted by SBI to the ERP system, same as Branch mode, and the transaction will get updated in ERP. There will be no manual intervention at IIT Kharagpur SBI Branch. In case of mismatch in either the amount or account number the amount will be refunded. The account number generated in the challan is for one time use only. For payment of semester fees the student has to generate the challan every time and remit the amount as per account no printed in the NEFT challan.
